# Venus

Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days.
It has no natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition.
It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide.


## Colonization

With the invention of the JumpDrive in 2237, the colonization of Venus turned from a highly-professional, deeply experimental field of research into something of a public interest. With the turmoil of the Second Revolt subsiding, colonization efforts were increasing.

Now that shuttling colonists back and forth from the reaches - both core-worlds and outer rim became that much more feasible, A small stream of exploratory souls living in cramped aerostats labs (Floating cities in the dense Venusian atmosphere) turned by 2239 into a complete wave in colonizing efforts testing various technological solutions to the harsh living conditions.

Venus proved to be a harsh planet to tame and to a very high degree remains inhospitable to human life. However, no less the seventeen  AeroStat type of colonies are now stationed in various heights and exploring several special features of the land.

The incredible  abundance of highly active materials that can be obtained from Venus had rendered it a prime testing location for advanced technologies and the home base of the Lansky Combine, headed by the Lansky Family - one of the most influential developers of the core worlds.


## Local Culture

Like any frontier-planet, Venus is just getting it’s grips on the second generation of local-born people. With most colonists arriving either from Mars or Earth with a few specialists from Luna and CERES - one can expect a particularly eclectic mashup.

Social Experts are quick to note that despite the ‘space-station’ quality of the aerostats, with every hole in the bulkheads positioning dangers - travel between aerostats is quick, effective and commonplace. Thus reducing many of the detrimental conditions unique to void-class space stations. That fact aside, most Venusians are known to be quick minded, easy going and very aggressive on their entrepreneurship.

Each AeroStat is fitted with it’s own self-representative system and allowed relatively autonomous rule on civil matters and a healthy rivalry between Venusian ‘Chapters’ as they had come to call themselves is rife and often quite friendly. 
One special note of the local, acid-etching for metallic objects has become some sort of a proud local art form as it often allows for more organic-like final result then most modern methods and some AeroStats boast beautiful outer shells that have been modified with massive acid-etching projects.
