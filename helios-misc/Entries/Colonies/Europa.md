# Europa

Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an iron and nickel core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare.

At just over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter, it is the sixth-largest moon and fifteenth-largest object in the Solar System. Though by a wide margin the least massive of the Galilean satellites, it is nonetheless more massive than all known moons in the Solar System smaller than itself combined. Its bulk density and composition is similar to the terrestrial planets, thanks to it being primarily composed of silicate rock.

Europa has an outer layer of water around 100 km (62 mi) thick; a part frozen as its crust, and a part as a liquid ocean underneath the ice.

The radiation level at the surface of Europa is equivalent to a dose of about 5400 mSv (540 rem) per day, an amount of radiation that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for a single day.


## Europa colony

Established 2195 thanks to the abundance of water and presence of oxygen in it's atmosphere, and despite the high levels of radiation on it's surface, Europa was the first colony founded on one of jupiter's moons, if only by a few monthes. In the first 15 years after it's founding, radiation protection and the limitations it placed on construction was the single most inhibiting factor in the colony's development. 

While the protection afforded by the habitats has been mostly effective, trace amounts of radiation have caused cancer and other ailments among early settlers. This unfortunate by product of the colonizing effort and the inability to completly prevent deaths as a result have given colonists a reputation of truculance, stand-offishness and mutation, all unjustified, as some of the federations best officers and enlisted hail from this small and important colony.

in the 100 year old colony has been since it's founding and still is a prime source of oxygen and water to the other colonies around jupiter, being in effect a supporting colony for the entire juvian stellar neighborhood.
