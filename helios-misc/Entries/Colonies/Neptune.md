# Neptune

Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units.


## Colony

The misleading name Neptune colony is often enough to make people mistake this successful experiment of social engineering and corporate design to a colony on the actual planet.

Originally marked as Project Triton - the Neptune mission was highly experimental and wholly chartered by three different corporations, literally creating the legal entity known as the Triton Foundation. This singular corporate entity is owned by shares now soundly split between the original owners, still with a majority at the directorate of over eighty percent and the rest is commercial with just over six percent belonging to the public federation.
Mining hyper-conductive-fluids from Neptunes crust and utilizing the immense energy potential of the howling winds at the planet below had become the main export of Neptune. As well as a tourist spot to view the huge blue planet and its various air-dancing performances.


### Planetary Colony

Venusian aerostats have been theorised for more permanent solutions on Neptune but the wholly different problems of heat preservation and accommodating the rapidly changing, stormy weather has made these plans implausible in the near future.


### Local Culture

Currently Triton is a productive, relatively safe watering hole this far out of sol - and since it's corporate legal composition, it's regulated as a corporate sub-sector with slightly wider autonomy range then the regular deviation of style. Mainly, Neptune is a place where libertarian values about the margins of agreement between consenting adults are far wider. 
Drugs - addictive or otherwise, psycho-active treatments, grey-area research and other such subject matters are often well within the rights of personal liberty. As well as a relatively wide allowance to carry and train with personal weapons.


### Local Law Enforcement

The Triton Peacekeepers are well trained and provided for by the corporate leaders and actual crime is quite rare. Though indeed, borderline deeds that would have been a crime anywhere else, including smuggling, are very often done. Sometimes openly.
Many on earth regard Triton with some romanticism of exploratory and frontier vision of some sort of a "wild west" of old. The reality is far, far, less romantic, but old habits die hard and more than one would-be fortune seeker had found themselves broke at the doorstep of the federated offices looking for a way back home.
