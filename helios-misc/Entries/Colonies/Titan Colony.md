# Titan

Titan, as the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, was colonized on 2201 as the lynchpin of the saturn project.
Techknowledge corporation, in a daring and dramatic business initiative, have struck an accord with the federal government, Launching a massive colonization project to populate real-estate around saturn.
Techknowledge's federal mandate was awarded in order to create a second ship-building shipyard system, in order to reduce the federal fleet's dependance on the Luna colony installations.
However, by most prominent economists' public estimations, Titan is decades away from matching luna's shipbuilding capacity.
Saturni Luna (Saturn's luna - titans' original name, chosen by it's dutch discoverer) is well establishd colony, but is still several orders of magnitude smaller than Luna, it's older sister.


## Capital of the "Saturn sector"

The Saturn's project stated purpuse was to colonize the celestial bodies around saturn (I.E. the saturn sector.). Despite the potential hazards of establishing a surface colony of a planet like moon with a nitrogen atmosphere, it's size and location in the saturn sector made it the most viable location as a population and societal hub.
Techknowledge's execution of the project is studied as a textbook example of a massive scale colonization project executed with forethought and efficiant, flexible planning.

Titan's current role in the saturn sector is as the local population hub, administrative center and cultural leader. The colony and it's surrounding subsidiary colonies contain business ventures and leased arcologies of all major corporations, though techknowledge still holds the greatest share of business and assets in the sector, estimated at 31%.
   
Most of the planetoid's population consists of corporate employees, giving rise to complaints from their out-colony neighbors, pianting them as a colony of profiteers and corporate drones.
The reality, however, is rarely as simple as that and the prosperity and relative security of the saturn sector stand as a testament to the commitment and effectiveness of the corporations operating in this remote solar sector.

## Present Day Titan

The domed cities of titan are massive, pre-planned city arcologies. Hidden beneath dozens of kilometers of a thick nitrogen atmosphere, the domes create the feeling of home by displaying a virtual sky and sun, while also filling extra functions such as a power collection and resource extraction system by harnessing and havresting the nitrogen winds.
The plantoids' icey core is used in the distillation of oxygen and water that supports titan's limited food fabrication capacity and the surrounding stations and resource scarce colonies.

The society on titan, while highly regimnted physically, holds a spirit of exploration and experimetation as one of it's defining values.
New societal constructs are thought up and attempted - from the new Kibbutz generational experiment of wealth sharing and up to multi partner line families.
These social experimentations have served the acedemics and thinkers of titan well, placing them at the front of the valuable sceintific fields of anthropology and sociology.
This same spirit has also served to grant the titan citizens a reputation (mostly unjustified) of sexual promescuity and social sophistication.
