#Luna (Colony)
The first colony established by the Federation, 2037.

The first settlers arrived 5 years after the formation of the Federation - heroes on their way to conquer new, unknown lands, determined to baldly go where only few had gone before.
Luna is the gate to the solar system, and following that – the whole universe, and it was labeled as that from the start.

Builders, scientists, biologist, engineers and military personnel crowded the first shuttles, leaving behind a planet, just beginning to heal from the war that almost destroyed it, ready to take the first steps of humanity in its journey to the stars.
As the entire world watched, Luna was built as a utopia – a place where people from all across the Federation worked together, regardless of origin and religion, to the advancement of the human race.

The huge “Hephaestus” shipyard is building new shuttles and ships, ready to venture off into spaceץ The shipyard was up and running by the end of the first year, and in only a few short years the first domed cities were also operational, providing a home to the people operating the biggest technological endeavor the world has ever seen. Alongside the cities, the terraforming of the domed fields advanced quickly to the point where the colony was able to provide almost half its food requirements by the end of the second decade.

The establishment of the Mars mining colony was an important catalyst for the Lunar economy, and officially marked its place as Earth’s biggest and most accessible space port. By that time the shuttle traffic between Luna and Earth was as routine as the train services were only a few decades previously.
