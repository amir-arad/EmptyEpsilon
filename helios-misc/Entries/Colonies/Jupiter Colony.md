# Jupiter Colony

Established as part of the Jovian Project, 2195. The planetary conditions do not allow for deployment of a colony on the surface and so the Jupiter Colony consists of 3 Orbital Stations designated Jupiter - Alpha, Jupiter - Bravo and Jupiter - Charlie. Each of these stations serves a purpose the other two depend on. As a result, free movement between these essential parts is critical to their continued existence.

The Jupiter colony is administered by the Federation and is home to significant Federation Navy presence. Jupiter Colony is considered a Federal holding and is thus not a free port. While trade and business is ample and unrestricted, this colony is known for its particularly vigilant customs authorities.

## Jupiter Alpha

Jupiter Alpha Station was the first station of the triumvirate to be deployed and anchored in orbit of Jupiter. It was the cornerstone of the entire Jupiter project -  a celebration of human achievement. Jupiter Alpha holds the Colonial Administration office as well as the local Navy and MArine garrisons.


## Jupiter Bravo

Jupiter Bravo Station is a commercial hub in it's core. However, with time and demand the purpose of this station has changed and has become more varied. The station is now home to many businesses as well as entertainment facilities renown in the outer colonies.


## Jupiter Charlie

Jupiter Charlie Station is home to many research installations and educational facilities. Universities from across the federation rent workspaces here to conduct various research in conditions and environment the diverse laboratories of Jupter Charlie can provide.


## War torn past

Many tourists choose to visit Jupiter Colony to see the carnage left in the form of space debris, that has now joined with the infamous Jupiter Rings. These wrecks dating back to the second revolt remain as a stark reminder that any conflict in space leaves eternal scars.

During the Second Revolt, many officers of the Federation Navy that were born on Jupiter had defected. They later surrendered and were executed for treason. There has not been any rebelious tendencies in the sector since.
