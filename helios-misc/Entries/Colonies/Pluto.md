#Pluto

Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune.
It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered and the latest settelment to reach colony status at the year 2275. 
Pluto is the largest and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System, and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun.
Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—about one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume


##The Pluto Colony

The pluto colony has been settled by federal senate fiat. As pirate and raider activity reached proportions deemed intolerable by the federal senate (as well as the public out-cry in support of the long suffering outer colonies citizens).
The federation navy has been well prepared for this eventuality and swiftly set up a base on the surface of pluto while simultaniously constructing several military space stations in it's orbit.
A veritable exudos of military men and women and their families followed this relocation, bringing the settlement to colony status in record time. 


##Present Day Pluto

While many inhabitants of pluto are service providers for the families and service personnel, the colony's identity is very military oriented. Many of the colony's descendants join the sevice of the federation where they tend to do well in the already familiar surroundings.
Several generations of this cycle have created a military caste of sorts inside the federal military of service dynesties, gifting the federation with their sweat and blood.

The inhabiting of pluto may have not banished piracy from the solar system, but raiding and piracy has been in decline ever since the colony has been established, the citizen of the outer colonies given a much needed respite.
The plutonians are proud of this heritage and justly so.
