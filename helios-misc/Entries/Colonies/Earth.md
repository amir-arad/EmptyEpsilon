## Earth Society


### An age of Prosperity

Our present age is the height of human civilization. Mankind's dark ages and socio-economical backsliding is a thing of the past. The colonies of earth and the industry of the great corporations has unlocked our star systems' true economical potential and the posibilities are, litteraly, astronomical.

On earth, the average standard of living is higher then ever before. Life expectency has risen to new records and the greatest threats to the logevity of the average citizen has been extinguished. Cancer and other terminal illnesses are a thing of the past. Even citizens that become bereft of the means to support themselves are granted basic living stipends calculated by their basic income coefficient. Hunger is a thing of the past.

This remarkable feat is accomplished by the beneficent authority of the federal government that manages the taxes collected from the citizenry and the economical entities of the entire human race, re-allocating resources as needed. The federal government also supervises child-birth, to prevent the over-population tragedied of past centuries.


### Age of Enlightenment

Since the abolishment of the old doctrines (also known as the old religions), the greatest sources of tension and strife that have plagued mankind have finally been unmade. Logic, science and reason are the hallmarks of modarn human society.
