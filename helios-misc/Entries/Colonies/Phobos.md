# Phobos

Hardly a significant piece of rock in space - Phobos made a name for itself for being one of the few projects to hollow out and craft an artificial gravity colony on the inside of an asteroid, as opposed to orbital space stations. 
The process of colonizing and hollowing with advanced machinery became somewhat easier with the fact that most of Phobos inner parts were already being fractured by tidal gravitation powers. This proved to be a boon in the effort to redirect and remake the dark moon into an outstanding success.
Now fully colonized and with the inner-space of Phobos partly terraformed, using the outer rocky crust to defend against cosmic radiation while holding two polar spars that extend into space in the largest shipyards outside the Moon - enjoying an influx of raw materials from Mars the same way the Earth supports the Lunar Space dockyards. 
The Phobian civility is unsurprising in its federated leniency. Designed from the inside out as four small, but efficient, sub-sectors despite the tiny populations. Three of the sub-sectors are blatantly Federated in their voting patterns with the Core Sub-Sector being more ambivalent, often attributed to the large Mars-Oriented culture centers.
