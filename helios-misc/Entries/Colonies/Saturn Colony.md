# Saturn

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.
The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system that is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. 84 moons are known to orbit Saturn. Most of the larger ones are associated with colony stations acompanning them on their orbit.
These stations include larger station colonies set up in the first stage of the saturn project, of whice most are federal holdings. 

The gas giant itself is orbited by "Saturn station". The saturn colony station is the center of the federal military authority in the saturn sector.
Besides holding a large federal servicemen population and their families, in orbit of saturn next to the station is the largest concentration of military ships in the saturn sector.

The gas giant itself is mined for resouces by large drone ships that scoop the atmoshpere. The resources collected are a large part of the sector's export depper into the outer rim.
Illegal mining operations are periodically detected and dismanteled.
Titan also holds a major Federal Navy training academy with new crews participating in patrols and assignments, policing the sector and getting hands on experiance.

## The "Saturn sector"

The colonies around Saturn and it's moons were built as part of the “Saturn Project”. In the wake of the success of the Jovian project, it was only a matter of time until Saturn and it's moons were treated similarly.
The Titan colony itself has become a major trade hub of the outer rim colonies and one could say it is the economic heart of the Rim.

While federal presence is clearly felt in the saturn sector and life for the average citizen are perfectly safe, the volume of trafic in the sector has led to attempts by smugglers and pirates to operate in the sector.
Such initiaives are however short lived, as most of the holdings in the sector are federal. Federal authorities assigned to the sector co-operate with corporate colony beaurocrats effectively in order to police the industry and transportation around saturn, making the sector much safer than any other outer-rim territory. 

## Present day Saturn sector

The present day Saturn sector is a new territory in many ways, but it is unequivocaly a beacon of civilization in the outer rim.
The Titan arcologies are a center of trade and recreation, art and social sciences. The Titan colony and the ships stationed there are used as a military deterrent of much of the lawlessness pernicious in other places.

Politically, the titan sector send 12 representatives to the senate, though thanks to the population concentration on titan, 10 of the 12 senators elected are from titan.
