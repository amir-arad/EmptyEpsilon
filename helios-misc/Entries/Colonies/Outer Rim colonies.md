# Outer Rim Colonies

The outer rim colonies are colonies that are outside the of the near asteroid belt. Most of these colonies were established as part of the Jovian Project and the Saturn Project and most of these colonies are space stations or undeployed colony-ships.
The planetary conditions do not allow for deployment of a colony on the surface, station-colonies are used instead.

Colonies around the solar system fill a multitude of roles. While some colonies excel at production or manufacturing, others procure resources and ship them to other colonies.
Some colonies excel at scientific research that can only take place off-world. Some provide the Zero-G conditions required for the constructions of space fairing vessels.

Within constellations of colonies such as the Jovian Project and the Saturn Project, inter-colonial trade and travel are very common and accessible.
Colonies further away from others normally have other means of sustainability and longevity, mostly technological.
