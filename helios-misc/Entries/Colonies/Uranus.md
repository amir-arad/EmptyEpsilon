# Uranus

Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49K, and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water making up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.


## Colony

Colonised in a significant number only after the events of the Second Revolt have resolved themselves.
With the emancipation act legalizing clemency to most rebel forces, there was still a need for a highly secure prison for the most radical elements. At first plans were drawn up to craft a prison spacecraft, but as the project wore on, it became clear a far better returning investment would be done on Uranus's largest moon - Titania.
While there were a few research vessels in orbit of the gas giant, the promise of liquid water and stable area to plant a fully functioning dome-city amidst the craters of Uranus, along with the tiny gravitational pull of the planet - making it possible to craft a fleet of ships designed to mine out the blue giant's higher layers for various materials as well as serve as a base for asteroid mining throughout the many moons and rings of Uranus.


## Local Culture

The relative proximity of many a radical elements, which were released in due time to the local population under supervision made the entire colony into something of a prison and convict mentality. Many ne'er-do-wells migrated there, conflating the problems and making the vote of the subsector clearly anti-federated on most subjects. 
It is considered run-down and ill-managed even at the best of times, with serious injury and even death events not being so uncommon as the repair status of the mining equipment and the domes themselves are at least two degrees below the level bar.
Most federated personnel are advised to stop in Uranus Colony only while on duty and move about in groups of three and more. The Iras Dome is an active prison facility and is governed by the local Garrison Commander.
