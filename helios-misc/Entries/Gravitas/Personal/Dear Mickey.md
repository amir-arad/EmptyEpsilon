Dear Mickey,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I apologize for not having written sooner. The times have been hard and not getting better. Finding jobs has been nearly impossible, and what employment can be found - usually does not last. We have both been trying very hard to provide for your brother… However, the situation, I must say, is not good. These Moonies really don’t take kindly to our type around here. It’s like they can smell the fringe on our clothes or something. Five years on this rock, you’d think we would adapt…
Your brother has been accepted to the community school just in the neighborhood. He is really looking forward to his first day of school, but we are worried that he may run into some bullying. Perhaps we are just too worried. I’m sure he will do great.

Please write back if you get the chance. We all love you very much, our little Mickey.

xoxo
Mom and Dad (and Robby!)
