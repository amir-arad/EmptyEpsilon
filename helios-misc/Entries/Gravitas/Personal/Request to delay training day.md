Recipient - Federation Navy Academy, Administration

Greetings and salutations dear comrades and compatriots. It has come to my attention that a group of cadets is to visit onboard the FNS Gravitas in 3 weeks.
As X.O of the Gravitas, and on behalf of the rest of the crew I must advise against this and insist the visit is canceled.

The FNS Gravitas is not adequate training grounds due to its delicate missions and sensitive operations. It is not an environment in which we, as profesionals, can both observe and teach these cadets while also adequately maintaining our ship and working to meet our objectives.

I must stress that sending cadets onto the Gravitas in it's current state and with it's orders as they stand - is no less than negligent.

A month and a half from now the ship will rotate. I believe that would be a better time for such field expedition for the cadets in a safe and educational environment.

Regards,

Aharon Smith
XO, Acting
FNS Gravitas
