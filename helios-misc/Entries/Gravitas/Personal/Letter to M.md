Dear M.

I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am for what went down and how it went down. We have all lost many we cared about that day. It is important for me to tell you that as strange as it may seem to you - I didn't know.
It wasn't how they told it. It wasn't how the news told it, or the navy.
There were 5 of us that went onboard. I was leading the team and our objective was simple. Disarm the nukes. We didn't know if they were holding on to them for a fight or for leverage, non of that mattered. We had our orderes.
We snuck in on one of the garbage disposal barges, wearing our vac-suits. Once inside we changed to plainclothes and made our way to the medbay 3, to meet our contact on the station. When we got there, we realized he got cold feet, and he ain't meeting us. With no way to communicate with HQ or any Federation vessels nearby, and with it being a war and all that, we decided to take some initiative and set off to find the nukes ourselves. It was no easy task, but I wasn't going to signal the fleet with the one transmitter I had, just to tell them the whole thing is off and the bad guys get to win.

We made our way to the storage area. On the way, we managed to make contact with some civies that were sympathetic to our cause. I knew there were civs on boards, but I had no idea there were this many. We had this listed as a military HQ, not a god damn rafugee camp. And damn those scum for using all of those people as a human shield, as well. The locals clued us in on whats going on: The rebel leader was a reasonable guy, they said, and can be talked to. He is looking for a way to de-escalate the situation, they said. We convinced them that the nukes were much more important, for everyones' safety. They were convinced, and pointed us in the right direction - Grey 56. A storage unit in grey sector, luckily - not far from where we already were.

The unit was guarded and we had to get our hands dirty to get in. Williams caught a stray in the fight for the door and went down. We could do nothing to help him and had to hide his body in the air vent for the time being.
After disposing of the dead guards, we entered. Khalid, our demo-tech, made quick work of the detonators and we were ready to take off. Then a monkey wrench was thrown in our plan.
The civs we spoke with earlier seemed to have a change of heart, and ratted us out. They called in the cavalry and the whole of Grey Sector of Reunion Station was flooded with rebels, junkers and fringers, all waving guns at us demanding us to surrender. I was reading the situation as pretty game-over, but Khalid, Johnson and Pedro felt it otherwise and opened fire. In the ensuing fight, they all died, those crazy bastards. What were they thinking?
The situation seemed hopeless, and I disarmed myself, asking to be taken to their leader, hoping they would value my life as long as I had useful information.

Their so called general was a tough guy. Or at least he tried his best to play the part. I urged him to stand down, telling him the nukes have already been disarmed and the cavlary is already on the way.
I bluffed, of course. They have taken the transmitter when they captured us, and before I had a chance to signal our boys.
There was nobody coming, yet.
To my surprise, he ate it. His expression changed very radically and he seemed relieved. After hearing the navy is coming while he is without any leverage, he was pretty receptive to simply letting us go and surrendering right there and then. With that, I grabbed the transmitter, and quietly pressed the button, as we made our way to the stations escape pods launchbay.

From the Escape Pod, I managed to establish direct comms with the Fleet, and let them know that the station is disarmed and ready to surrender. I told them to send in the Marines to take custody of the situation.
As I was accelerating away from Reunion, I saw the fleet warp in. The launch ports opened for what I assumed to be Marine Boarding Pods. As I approached the fleet, it became obvious that the launched objects were missiles, not transports. The station took multiple hits in critical sectors and became unanchored, pivoting and beginning to rotate. As explosions kept erupting, the station was being accelerated towards the nearby asteroid, with which it eventually impacted. Very few people survived, and I swear, I had no idea you had people there, nor that this could happen at all.

I'm sorry.

Yours,
A.S
