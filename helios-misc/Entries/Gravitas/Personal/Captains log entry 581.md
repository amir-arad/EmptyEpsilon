Captain's log. Entry 581

Yesterday, Intelligence have decoded a message we picked up on broad beam, from a former Techknowledge scientist, Dr. Heart, who is now aligned with the MCF. 
It would seem that he had brought a highly dangerous and lethal technology with him, with the hope it would never be used. Since it was used, he found himself an accomplice to terrorist acts. He now contacted the Federation, looking for a way out. 

After watching the message several times, I believe he is sincere, and that he wishes to repent. There are no excuses for him, but there might be salvation, and therefore he deserves to be helped, and to face a court of justice for his crimes.


There is strong reason to believe the MCF would use Dr. Heart's technology again, in more terrorist attacks, and so, in retrieving him we are not only offering the man a chance to escape life as a mass murderer, but also saving the potential victims of said attacks. 


Dr. Heart asked to be contacted through the Technigma system, which my comms officer tells me is outdated, rarely used and allows for untraceable messaging. However, in order to contact Dr. Heart specifically, to arrange his retrieval, we would need his Technigma transmission code.We should try reaching out to our contacts in Techknowledge to see if they can help us get it. Once obtained - we retrieve Dr. Heart.
