To anyone in the Federation who may get this.

My name is Dr. Eric Heart, and I am in need of your immediate help.

Several years ago, I have worked in Techknowledge, where I have developed a highly dangerous technology, involving the remote activation and deactivation of reactors. Since then I have done everything in my power to prevent it’s misuse.I have put my trust in the MCF and now realise it was a grave mistake. I did not believe they will, but they have used it, and it cost lives. Many of them.

I’m reaching out to the Federation now, hoping that you will be able to decrypt this message and more over that you could help me.
Billions of lives are at risk.

The MCF could no longer be trusted with my technology. I must get out.

If you can - please contact me via the Technigma system. If you can’t, please forward this to someone who can.
This is of the utmost importance, I cannot stress this enough.

Thank you for your effort,
Dr. Heart.
