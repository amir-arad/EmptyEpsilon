# Proxima Centauri b colony ship - ahead of schedule

Spirits are high and the music is soaring, as these happy travelers and colonists have started boarding the FSS O’Neil, which was originally scheduled to depart in late February.
The FSS O’Neil, the largest Colony Ship to depart on its voyage, is now scheduled to depart on December 27th, instead. It’s destination - Proxima Centauri b.
The O’Neil is destined to be the first Colony ship to leave the bounds of our solar system and continue the epic journey of humanity into the stars and beyond. It is thus no surprise that Federal Authorities have decided to expedite the proceedings and aim to enable the ship to be launched in time for the new year.

However, not everything is as cheerful as it seems on the surface. Sources within the crew (whose identity we cannot publish at this time) report that the Ship is in fact not prepared for departure and that much work remains to be done.
Other sources report ignored complaints of manpower shortages and other logistical delays.

Despite the festive environment, here, on the docking platforms, it seems celebration may be too early, as some of the settlers and colonists will inadvertently fail to finish making their preparations due to the rescheduling of departure.
