# The Ceres Foundation (Corporation)

Resource extraction from the near astroid beld.
The CERES foundation is a story of success snatched from the jaws of failure. After the fiscally unprofitable mining of Ceres, the CERES foundation have used the expertise garnered from this endeavor coupled with efficient, frugally designed mining ships into producing a great economical boom. This success has been responsible for improving the varied economies of the human race. The CERES foundation have compounded this success. It was first compounded by extending opertaions and building multiple colonies in the near astroid belt. Later, it was compounded again by Ceres becoming a gateway and a major waystation for the colonization and of and trade with the outer rim.

Modern day CERES foundation is the owner of Ceres and is the only core world colony with a corporatly elected representatives sent to the federal senate.
