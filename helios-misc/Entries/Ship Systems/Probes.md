# LF-2 Science probe
The LF-2 Science probe was developed by the Mushai corporation and is the standard long range reconnaissance and science probe used by the Federation Navy. The probe has an active sensor depth of 4.5U and allows remote observation and analysis of objects.


All navy ships can carry the LF-2 probe. The amount of probes a ship may carry changes depending on size and classification of the vessel. In the Federation Navy the deployment of the LF-2 probe is given to the communication station which reroutes the probe’s output to the science station.


Navy protocols dictate that before launching a probe the acting officer on the bridge (if not the captain) must get a verbal confirmation from the captain. This is done in order to maximize the usefulness of a probes and surveillance in fleets.
