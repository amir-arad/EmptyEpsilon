# Warp Highways - Technical Advisory

During the development of Warp Engines, A companion technology was developed. 
As limits of the warp technology were discovered, the theoretical creation of assiting technological solutions were deemed necessary.
This led to a more detailed scrutiny of how to engineer the Warping effect to create a warp highway.
Warp highways interact with warp engine technology to multiply the travel speeds possible along specific routes.

While the need for activating Warp engines in a safe distance from other objects remains in effect, activating warp engines in a warp highway has no effect unless calibrated to the highways' frequencies.
It is also possible to calibrate a warp core while already inside a warp highway, as interacting with it while uncalibrated has no effects.

A warp highway is created using specialized warp cores, activated in sync with each other. 
The larger the warp core, the longer and wider the area of effect.
Major highways have a wide area of effect with increased warp velocity the closer you fly to the center of the highway.
