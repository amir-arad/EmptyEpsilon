# Warp Jam - Scientific Phenomena

Early warp technology experiments revealed a very real danger inherent to the use of warp drives.
Even minor and remote masses caused enough spatial disturbance resulting in catastrophic engine failures.
Only deep-space, in 'clean' areas where density of residual matter was far enough from the warp engine activation point was the finalizing of the research and deploying of this technology possible.

Current standardized procedure deployed each such core with active-alert detectors that engage whenever a Warm Sequence is started.
These scanners use a derivitive technology to look for the spatial jamming caused by dangrous masses.
Only in clean space will the alert detector approve initiation of the warp speeds.
Without the detectors' approval of a safe transition, the warp core would not launch the ship into warp speed.

Standard procedure demands that 20U of clear space to be available for the safe activation of Warp engines.
failure to comply can result in catastrophic damage to the Core and Ship.
