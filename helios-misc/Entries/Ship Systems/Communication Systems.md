# Short Range

The FNS Gravitas Short Range Communication system is the default communication system used by the crew. It allows the ship to communicate to ranges of up to 10U, however, this range can be deminished by various conditions. Reliable range is considered up to 5-10U.
This system allows for two-way audio communication.


# Medium Range

Within 50U, it is possible to establish a communication channel with another vessel using the Medium Range communication system. If the recipient accepts the hail and returns it, direct audio communication can take place.


# Long Range

It is possible to send a textual communique to any ship according to it's designated callsign. The signal may take time to reach the recipient, depending on range and environmental conditions. There is no way to confirm whether the transmission is received unless a reply is sent.
