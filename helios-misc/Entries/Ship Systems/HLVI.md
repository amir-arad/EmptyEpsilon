# HVLI (High Velocity Lead Impactor)

HVLI, considered by some as an antiquated idea, can be seen on almost all navy vessels. The HVLI are a set of lead non-combustible high velocity projectiles fields by an electromagnetic rail gun mounted on any surface. A standard HVLI volley shots 5 projectiles in a direct line.

Rail guns were first used by colonial forces during the first revolt, as they were a perfect weapon against federation stationary stations. Unlike federation ships that had both high maneuverability and formidable hull, stations, being stationary, could be hit consecutively with high levels of accuracy, thus negating the low damage potential of non-combustible projectiles.

With the introduction of the electro-gravimetric field technology and the creation of bigger and stronger shields, rail guns and non-combustible weapons became obsolete for many years.

Only during the second revolt did a need for cheap and easily manufactured projectiles arise in the federation navy. Armaments needed to be created close to the conflict areas, as those areas became further aways from sol. It was during this time that general Friedrich von Mackensen ordered asteroids to be mined and new rail guns be installed on his ships.

Mackensen understood the relative weakness of the projectiles against modern shields of the time. To combat this Mackensen ordered the the projectile to be both bigger and contains elements of both copper and iron in the ball. Giving the projectile a small magnetic field before lunch allowed them to bypass weak areas in the enemy shields and causes damage to the ship's hull itself. General Mackensen was awarded the star of the federation at the end of the war.
