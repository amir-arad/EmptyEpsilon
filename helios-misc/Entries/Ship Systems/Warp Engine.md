# Warp Engines

First built in 2100, the warp drive allowed spaceships to create a warp field around them.
Using this warp field the ship is able to move far faster than what is possible using an impulse drive.
The first warp engine was created by the federation technology corps as an attempt at achieving faster than light speeds.

The first warp engines required a large technical staff to maintain and caused structural damage for the ship while in operation.
Some of this damage was negated when the navy developed and deployed low intensity shielding technologies to deflect minor space debris.

Warp engines today still require a large amount of power and create considerable amounts of heat.
So much so that using of warp speed 3 requires a direct command of the 1st officer or captain and warp 4 can only be issued by the captain.

Warp travel is considered safer than the jump drive, especially when covering long distances.
The is due to the fact that jump technology is not as old and reliable as warp technology and that jumps doesn't allow ships to travel to areas they have no current information about.
Because of this, all navy vessels are equipped with warp drives.
