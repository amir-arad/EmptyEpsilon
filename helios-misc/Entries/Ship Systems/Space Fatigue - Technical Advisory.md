# Space Fatigue - Medical Condition

All modern manuals regarding the safety and regulation of long-term operations of space vessels include comprehensive treatment of the medical condition called space fatigue.
Studies have concluded that refraining from steady cycles of operation, even during emergency operations, induces the onset of Space Fatigue.
Some or all of the following symptoms result:
Tardiness, Lethargic reactions, impediments in thinking, unusual sensitivity to nutrient intake, dizziness and hallucinations.
These symptoms can be treated or at least alleviated by lying in a horizontal position, rest and person specific nutritional supplements authorized by medical authorities such as the Federated Navy Medical corp or licensed medical companies.

Remember soldier,
SPACE FATIGUE IS THE SILENT ENEMY, DO NOT LET YOUR GUARD DOWN!
-- Federated Navy deployment manual slogan, Found in lavatories around Luna's shipyards.
