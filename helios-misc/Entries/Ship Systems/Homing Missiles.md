A simple, high-speed missile with a small warhead.

Except for HVLIs, missiles home in on any target selected by the Weapons officer. Otherwise, the missile is dumb-fired and flies in a straight line from its tube. The Weapons officer can choose to lock the tube's aim onto a target or disable the lock to manually angle a shot.
