# Long Range Sensors

The science station of any federation vessel contains one of the most important tactical tools available to a commander - the long range tactical sensors. The long range sensors allow a ship to classify and analyze any enemy or friendly ship in a 25U radius.

On the edge of the radar are colored bands of signal interference that can vaguely suggest the presence of objects or space hazards even further from the ship, but it's up to the Science officer to interpret them.

Green - Mass spectrometer. The greater the mass of the object the greater the effect on the green line
Blue- Electromagnetic radiation. Most things emit some amount of electromagnetic radiation and the blue line indicates the amount of radiation coming from the object. The sensors are calibrated so they would also catch Hawking-Zeldovich radiation.
Red - Spectrometer. All visible and near visible wavelengths are measured by the Red line. 


## Deep Scans

The long range sensors have the ability to do a longer and more throughout scan of a vessel. This scan will return information about shield status, beam frequencies and ship systems.
A more difficult scan yields more information about the ship, including its shield and beam frequencies.
The helms and weapons screen can also see the firing arcs of deep-scanned ships, which helps them guide your ship away from being shot by their beams.


## Nebulae

Nebulae block the ship's long-range scanner. The Science officer cannot see what's inside or behind them, and while in a nebula the ship's radars cannot detect what's outside of it. These traits make nebulae ideal places to hide for repairs or stage an ambush. To avoid surprises around nebulae, relay information about where you can and cannot see objects to both the Captain and the Relay officer.
