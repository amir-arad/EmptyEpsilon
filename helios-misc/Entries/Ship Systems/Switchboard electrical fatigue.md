# Switchboard Electrical Fatigue

When a system is overclocked (given more than 100% power) all switchboards connected to it will begin to accumulate electrical fatigue. The more electrical fatigue a switchboard has the greater a chance it has of suffering an electrical error

A switchboard's blue indicator light signals that the switchboard is in optimal shape and has accumulated no electrical fatigue. A switch with a blue light should be able to run continuously without need for maintenance. 


## Portable Discharge Unit

The portable discharge unit is used in almost all federation navy ships and isa critical item which must be available at all times. The portable discharge unit allows a qualified engineer to discharge the electrical fatigue accumulated in a switchboard (hot reset). A hot reset will remove any excess electrical fatigue on the board but will not fix any errors if they are present.

To use the portable discharge unit simply connect it to the switch, press the red button and wait for 30 seconds until the hot reset is complete. After this time the switch will remain online and will not need to be started.
