# Shields System 
With advances in the field of beam weapons and anti gravimetric fields the need for dynamic defence systems arose. Shield systems create an electro-gravimetric field around them permeating through physical substances inside it.

Electro-gravimetric field technology is used in most spaceships today. A basic field is constantly being maintained around any space faring vehicle. This field is used to deflect asteroid and space dust that might otherwise harm both the ship and the personal inside it. The more commonly known shields are an extension of this basic fields. By exerting more power the field can be extended and expanded to surround the ship and protect it from laser fire.

Although all shield system protect against laser fire, the specific frequency of the shield determine their effectiveness. A properly calibrated laser weapon can pass through most of the shield negative field. This is done by calibrating the laser beam frequency to the reverse frequency of the shield systems.

Shields do not protect against large physical objects, such as missiles and mines. More so, a close EMP charge could destabilize the shields for a short period of time. Although the ship itself is not harmed by an EMP blast, the shield field, which is outside of the ship's hull is affected.
