# Switchboard error handling
A switchboard's yellow indicator light will be on when an electrical fault has been caused in the switch. Despite this error, the switchboard has not suffered permanent damage and thus can be easily fixed by a restart of the board.

An electrical error can occur when the switchboard accumulated too much electrical fatigue. When a system has suffered an error all systems connected to is will begin to accumulate heat. These systems will continue to accumulate heat as long as the error is active and the switch is online.

## Restart stages - Hard reset 
 *Press red button until green indicator light begins to blink.
 *Wait 30 second until green indicator light has been switched off.
 *Press green button until green indicator light has begun blinking.
 *Wait 30 seconds for the board to be online.

## Important notes
 *When the green indicator light is off, the system if offline. 
 *During shutdown, the system is online, until the green indicator light stops blinking.
 *During startup, the system is offline until the green indicator light stops blinking. 
 *When a switchboard is offline all systems connected to it will not be supplied by the power relays on the switchboard.
