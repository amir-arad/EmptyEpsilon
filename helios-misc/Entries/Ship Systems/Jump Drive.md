# Jump Drive

Invented by the Federation Technology Corp in the year 2237. The Jump drive was created in order to address the growing demand for instant travel of navy ships. Although already in development, the revolt of 2234 emphasised the importance of instant travel for navy ships.

The technology is a closely guarded secret of the Federation Navy. Personnel that require direct access to a Jump Drive must pass rigorous tests and background checks. Even technical staff on large navy vessels normally know only what they need to know in order to fill their post.

At first, the Jump Drive technology was only allowed for navy ships, this was due the strategic importance this technology held for the navy, as well as logistical and technical issues with the systems.

In the year 2250 the Sol federation allowed singular private ships access to the technology. The first civilian ship to have the Jump Drive installed was the "Cosmic Mask". Civilian ships needed to pass harsh standards in order to qualify for the usage of a Jump Drive. These qualification also require special technical support and a yearly review of the system and the ship itself.

The jump drive, due to it's high power usage a need for a full team of technicians to operate is only installed on large ships such as dreadnoughts and other capital ship classes. Despite this restriction the drive does exist in some cruiser and destroyer class ships.

Despite advances in drive technologies over the years the distance a jump drive was able to transport a vessel has never exceeded <<Redacted>>. Traveling greater distances causes the jump drive to collapse and obliterate both itself and the ship.
