An electromagnetic pulse (EMP), also sometimes called a transient electromagnetic disturbance, is a short burst of electromagnetic radiation. EMP interference is generally disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment.

EMP main function is to damage the shield system of enemy ships, leaving them vulnerable to other types of weapons. Upon impact, high explosives located in the front of the warhead is tearing the outer shell and allows the EMP generator to come in touch with the target, delivering concentrated magnetic pulse.
