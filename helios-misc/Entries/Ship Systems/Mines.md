# Nuclear mines

Mines were first used by the federation navy in the first revolt where the navy stations deployed them to stall colonial forces until the arrival of federation ships. The first mines used did not do a lot of damage to enemy ships. Fortunately, colonial ships had relatively little armor and even minor explosions could cause permanent damage.

Before the second revolution federation mines had started to be outfitted with hydrogen bombs, the same bombs used in the federation's nuclear missiles. Having the same payload, mines hold a great danger to unaware ships as the damage they do in close range is extremely high.

Today, mines are used in both offence and defencive actions. Some captain pride themselves on their ability to anticipate enemy movement in the thick of battle in order to maximize the effectiveness of nuclear mines.
