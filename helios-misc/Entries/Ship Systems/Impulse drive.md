# Impulse Drives 

The impulse drive is the basic propulsion system used in all spaceships. The impulse drive’s output is generally considered the stern of the ship. Note that this is not always the case as some colonial ships have multiple impulse outputs.

The impulse drive is the only long term propulsion available for ships as other methods such as warp drives are extremely inefficient in terms of power usage. Due to this, impulse is generally used in either tactical combat or movement in close proximity to other ships.

After the first revolt navy command has concluded that federation ships needed the ability to make instant maneuvering during combat. For this, the federation navy started equipping all navy vessels with maneuvering jets.

Maneuvering jets fire a high energy wide arced ion beam. These beams push the vessel with tremendous force in the opposing direction. Due to the stress put on the hull and the amount of energy needed for even a short burst of these engines the maneuvering jets can only be activated for a short period of time before needing to recharge.
