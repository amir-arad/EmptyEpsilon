# Automatic Repair System
The automatic repair system is the pinnacle of damage control systems. Developed by the federation RnD corps, the automatic repair system employs a wide array nanomachines, each capable of both assessment and repair of almost all of a ship's vital systems.

The nanomachines are activated by automatic repair protocol (named ECR) which is loaded and directed in FUGAZI. Note! Due to the wide array of systems and the limited supply of nanomachines available for any federation vessel only one system can be repaired at any given time.

To repair a system the nanomachines rely on a steady power supply. The main power supply the nanomachines will use is the one powering the system they are currently fixing. If the system does not supply enough power the nanomachines will use internal power supply (which would slow down the repair speed by a factor of 2). Due to this, be wary of powering down any switchboards while the repair is ongoing.
