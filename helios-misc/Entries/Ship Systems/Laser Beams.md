# Laser Beams 

The Laser Beams used in Federation ships can be categorized into three categories:
High energy beams - Laser, Electromagnetic radiation etc.
Particle beams - Photon beams, Ion cannon etc
Other - Gravitational beam
Each of the different beams is used on different navy vessels and in different circumstances. Despite the wide variety of beams the Laser beams are considered the primary attack weapon of any Federation ship.
 
Laser beams can be used for both attacking specific enemy systems and the hall of an enemy ships. Note, the laser beams do not penetrate shields. Only after a ship's shield have been dissipated by repeated laser fire can the beams attack the ship itself.
 
When analyzing ships, note the placement and amount of beam cannons available to the ship. Although standard protocols dictate that the beams be distributed in the bow of the ship, many caption have opted to diversify the placement of their beam weapons.

To counter beam weapons most ships have at least one shield generator. Firing the beam in a counter frequency to the one used by the shield will allow the beam to have maximum effect. A science officers main duty during a firefight is to note enemy shield frequency changes and report them to the weapon officer.
