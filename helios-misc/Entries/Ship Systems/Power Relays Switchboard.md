# Ship Power Relays - Switchboards 

The ship's reactor supplies power to all systems on the ship. This power is passed via 6 switchboard stations scattered across the ship. 

##Ship Switchboards functions:

The Switchboards function as power hub to distribute power from the main reactor to different ship systems. A single switchboard can supply power to multiple ship systems.
In the event of a failure on a switchboard, it will be stopped suppling its systems and their efficiency will be affected. For example, a system that is being fed from 3 switchboard is losing one of them, will operate at maximum 77% efficiency. 
Repairing and maintaining the power relay switchboards is felling under the responsibility of the engineering department.
