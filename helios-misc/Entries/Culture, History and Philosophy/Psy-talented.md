# Psy-talented

The last century saw a rise in detection of psy-talented individuals and multiple federal programs exist to develop and cultivate their abilities. These men and women, if enlisted to teh federation may find it easy to become comissioned officers, most common in the intelligence divisions of branches of the AFSF.

Known Psy-talented abilities do not extend as far as fiction often depicts. There are some increased sensitivities, some increased awareness and in some cases a distinct ability to serve as a human lie detector in situation where the results of such interogation are not pertinent or legaly relevant.
