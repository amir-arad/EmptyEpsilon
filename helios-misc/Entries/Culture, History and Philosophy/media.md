# Media and Broadcasts

From local pamphlets, through the throngs of Mesh-Based info-dumps common in all civilian networks - information is ubiquitous in the federation. The prime Media outlets deliver a well packaged and personalized media streams that has been edited and trimmed to apply maximum relevant content to premium users.  Everyone else can get the regular datastream and customize it themselves. Most do.


## FedNet

Giving the average civilian a taste of what’s it like outside the space-station or hab-block. Transmitting over a rapidly building mesh made out of local computer-capabilities and local offices to digest the larger picture and deliver local news. FedNet is wholly owned by the government and has priority channels to override local casts in emergencies.


## Barsoom

Barsoom is Mars-Oriented and is considered a roguish and ex-earth oriented. Most people tend to take the news from both organizations with an equal measure and they have a good reputation of making fine journalism.


## Crayon and SatLight

Turn and contrast, Crayon and SatLight are both wholly-owned, private corporations making money out of sheer ‘wow’ factor and often are less then airtight about their fact-collection scruples. However, SatLight is decidedly liked on space stations around the federation since their series of musical hits.  Currently SatLight is Lunar-Based but contains a wide variaty of voices, including a few outer-rim vidcasters that garner a surprising rating in their target audiences.
Crayon is the all round ruckus causing life-vid-feeds that’s came to be synonymous with the rebellious youth wherever they are. Often stylized with a bright yellow crayon-like stick they use to paint into the local AR mesh. There’s an ongoing debate about the legality of these intrusive tactic to reach the audience but so far it’s been rather drawn out and not enough public resentment had built up to shut the firm down.


## VoidEcho

Transmitted on neutrino bursts and moving somewhere in the asteroid belt - the voice of VoidEcho is a familiar sound on the less well regulated places in the Federation. Consistently appearing wherever someone built a neutrino receiver and/or another pirate relay. 
VoidEcho drums up the voice of the Frontier. Often relating to the Federation in an almost hostile if not demeaning ways


## Local Agencies

Local agencies disseminate information vie MESH computing systems. Paper is a relic of a lost age by now - with AR vids displaying themselves in the field of vision for easier reading. Such MESH-AR interfaces create a seamless news telemetry and everyone with a recorder is an investigative journalist. Often enough, local groups pore over the media and make interesting commentaries. These bulletins are the most common sort of Media available to the masses.
