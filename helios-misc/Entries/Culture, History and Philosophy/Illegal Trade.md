# Illegal Trade

In the federated space trade is relatively easy to conduct - with stable space lanes and moving of information as well as physical goods done in a quick and efficient way since the development and deployment of the jump drive. More archaic ways of delivering goods still exist and since the Federation restricts certain sorts of goods, traffic in them is done in all sorts of black markets.

## Military Grade Technology

Weapons regulations are rather strict around the Federation, with space station ushering even stricter rules over ownership or even possession of a deadly firearm. As such, arms dealers are quiet as hull-rats if at all possible. 
Dealing with irregularly fabricated material. It is suspected that most illegal arms in the solar system arise from certain Junker rings in the asteroid belt but nothing is certain.


## Restricted Medication

Since most drugs are relatively easy to procure and produce - hydroponics and artificial synthesized variants are rife within the lower social stratas as well as several higher-living individuals. Experimental drugs tend to hit the market with promises of enlightenment and higher mental functionality - often with debilitating side-effects.


## Dirty Ore

Illegaly extracted or mined, these ores are possibly tainted or impure, as they have gone through unregulated procedures of procurement.
Ores and minerals mined and extracted in space are subject to federal regulation and taxation, which some individuals deem too high or inappropriate, resulting in a black market of industrial supplies. These unregulated or "Dirty" ores are often processed or refined in illegal refining facilities operated by undesirables.
