# The Fringe

The Fringe is a sector of the Kuiper Belt Objects lying just outside the legal periphery of the Federation and the Solar System.
Too far for comfort, but a steady and sturdy source of volatiles and potable water as well as setting the foot as far from earth as humanly possible in any permanent orbit. Two space-station of fixed orbit have been established formally by Federation-Based corporations, as well as many smaller facilities. However, many more unregistered and ilegal entities and facilities are common.


## Mining

Mostly freelancing mini-corporations of free-minded individuals acting on bounties for specific materials and objects demanded by the ever-expanding Federation Core Worlds. It's easy to get lost out here at the Fringe and they share a kindred mind with the many mining colonial families at the asteroid belt. 
Utilizing various technologies where small, sturdy-minded humans can endure at the edge of human industry.
Taking up to three months at a time to mine out pockets of useful material and returning to the main shipping docks in the space stations known as the Neighborhoods by the locals and the frequent visitors and business people.


## Trade

Some trade takes place in and around the Fringe. Corporations, companies, individuals which have some reason to conduct their business outside of Federal Jurisdiction.
The Fringe is a frequent source of contraband captured by the Federation Navy.
