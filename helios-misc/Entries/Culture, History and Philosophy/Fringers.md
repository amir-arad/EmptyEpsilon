# Fringers

These anti-social hoarders tend to take the ticket out and never be seen again, with their own unique culture near the end of the solar system.
Stories of space-cults, lawlessness, marauding and piracy are mostly heard from these individuals when they do come about and surface in Federation Space.
Some of these mena nd women are considered undesirables or outlaws, while others have chosen a self imposed exile for whatever reason.
