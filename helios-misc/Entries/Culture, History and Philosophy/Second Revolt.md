# Second Revolt

The Second Revolt is a term used to describe an armed conflict between the Federation and various rebelious factions vying for increased colonial autonomy.


## Causes

Following the reforms of 2219, legislation was passed to reinstate Federal Governors over local parliaments - also instating a wider control over movement of citizens between colonies.

Many say the first shot was fired nearly a decade before the Second Revolt - when President Joan Suarez Da’Lima died in office.
A thorough investigation blamed a previously undiagnosed heart condition.
Dissenters claimed it was murder for the attempts made in the Higher Chamber to repeal the Peaceful Core Act.


## Backlash and Response

Widespread disregard to due process and Core Values of the Federation caused the disbanding of the local Police office and replaced with Federal Police forces, regulated and governed by the Central Office rather than from the local governing body.

Separatist movements urged larger freedoms in both the Presidential Office and Local Parliaments. Several moves were made to repel the entire Federated Concord and remake humanity into truly separate nations.

Eventually, with public support of separatist movements reaching a boiling point, unending deadlock at the Parliament and utter disregard of the Higher Chamber during years 2234 and up to 2238, the Second Revolt escalated.


## Hostilities

The separatist parties were all political rivals rather than an actual threat to the federation. No army, no field forces, nothing to declare revolt with. For generations, however, most officers and officials tended to come from the inner and outer colonies. A disproportional amount of officers and highly trained personnel had to make the call between Federal loyalties and their home-settlements and colonial families.

An unexpected amount of them chose to remain loyal to home rather than federation. Enough space-faring vessels deserted and defected to make a rebel fleet a real threat.
With so many competent leaders and trained personnel, combined with pirate tactics and guerrilla warfare on all fronts, the Second Revolt was close to becoming a civil war.

Despite their fighting spirit and best efforts, the Federation Navy and it's numbers could not be defeated or deterred.

The butcher’s bill came to tens of thousands, mostly from space-debris crashing into populated areas. Several space stations were reduced to inoperable status during desperate guerrilla fighting.


## Conclusion and Abdication

Four years of grueling reforging of the Federation Navy, including the introduction of the Jump Drive during 2237 - made the war slowly grind to a halt until the Revolt subsided.

The President had abdicated on the whole at the end of the revolt.
Severe punishments were imposed on many of the separatist higher ranking officers - some were executed, some imprisoned, some - pardoned.

While the revolt had gained some of the outer colonies an increased degree of autonomy in the form of local legislation capabilities, it has also brought the Federation Navy, and with it the Federal Marine Corps to all of them - to stay.
