# Current day piracy

Despite all attempts to stamp out piracy in the solar system, despite lulls in activity and stretches of intense efforts, pirate attacks have never been fully halted. The ability to build new ship with independently acquired materials, not to mention the existence of unsanctioned settlements itself allows at least an number of evil minded opportunists to attempt attacks every year.

Periods of unrest or economic turbulence have also seen whole ships disappear as crews hijack their own ships to turn pirate and attack their former fellow merchants and space haulers. In the present day, those black hearted villains use the unregistered ports in the belts to provide them with home bases, Markets for stolen goods and sources of solace and information.


## Piracy in the future

Despite valiant and ceaseless efforts for dozens of years, many triumphs and brilliant operations, the federal navy has not managed to eradicate space piracy. This failure, while baffling at first, was easily explained by the Danzky formula. It was proven to be a mathematical impossibility to eradicate independent piracy as long as independent colonization is possible.

Therefore, until significant advancements in scanning technology is achieved and complete scans of the solar system is possible, it has been publicly accepted that piracy will be extant, if not rampant.
