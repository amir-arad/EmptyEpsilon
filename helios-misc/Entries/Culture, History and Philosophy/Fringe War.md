# Fringe War

The Fringe War was a conflict in The Fringe which refers to three years of war fought between the Federation and the MCF, supported by groups of terrorists as well as armed pirate groups, within what was defined as the "Security Zone" in The Fringe.

The creation of a Security Zone in The Fringe benefited civilian of the Federation, although at great cost to Fringers. It was necessary in order to combat piracy and securing key science expeditions against raids of opportunity.

Despite federal success in eradicating MCF bases and its partial withdrawal after some months, the federal invasion increased the severity of conflict with local Junker militias and resulted in the consolidation of several local movements in The Fringe from a previously unorganized guerrilla movements.

Over the months, military casualties of both sides grew higher, as both parties used more modern weaponry, and the MCF progressed in its tactics.

After a surge in hostilities threatened the Security Zone established by the Federation Navy an order was issued by the Chiefs of Staff to begin a full fledged assault on Reunion Station, a key installation that would cripple the MCF activity in the sector. With Reunion Station destroyed, the MCF forces have dispersed from the field and no major resistance fleets have been formed since.

The Security Zone proved to be a costly endeavor and with popular support ever on the decline for warfare in the Fringe, a directive to withdraw was issued following the 2286 Federal elections, by the newly sworn in government.

By the end of the conflict, the MCF, with support from other Fringers, junkers, pirates and terrorists, emerged as the leading group and military power, monopolizing guerrilla activity in The Fringe.
