# The Mimas Spore

The Mimas spore is an aggressive strain of space bourn organism, originally found on Mimas, the moon of Saturn. While the Mimas Spore is actually not of the fungi kingdom, it does share some traits with it, mainly spore-like distribution, from which it gets its name and its common nickname Space Fungus.


## First Encounter

The first encounter of humanity with the Mimas Spore was in 2203, when a research party that landed on Mimas first recognized it, bringing samples to study, without realizing the spores have also found their way onto the ship. The spores quickly spread across the spaceports and are now considered to be present in every spaceport and on every ship.

## Colonization

When close to each other, the Mimas Spores affect each other to multiply in colony form, creating a
rapidly growing gelatinous green/dark green substance.
Undetectable before the colony stage, the Mimas spore is an Electrophilic organism, usually
accumulating on Circuit boards, electric panels, computer servers etc. although it can grow anywhere.


## Effects

When growing on an electronic device, the Mimas Spore can cause rapid decay of circuits and
overheating, frequently causing systems to malfunction.
Until this day it is uncertain if the Mimas Spore is virulent towards humans. It has known to cause severe skin irritations upon contact and in some cases it has been known to cause allergic reactions.
There are no reported cases of specific illness related to the spore. The spore can also use the human skin as habitat and so it is recommended to never touch the Mimas Spore colony without protective gear.


## Handeling

Since currently, there is no way to identify the Mimas Spores before the colonies reach a visually identifiable size, and there is no known way to prevent their spreading, the only way to prevent electronics malfunction is to routinely detect all spore colonies, removing them using specialized tools and storing them in special capsules until disposal via incineration.
Direct exposure should be treated by washing the affected area with warm water and soap for 30 seconds or more.
