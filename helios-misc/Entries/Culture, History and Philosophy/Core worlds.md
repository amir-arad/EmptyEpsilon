# Core worlds

The Core worlds are colonies that lie within the circumference of the near asteroid belt. These colonies represent mankind's early attempts at colonization and today hold most of humanity's extra-terran population.
As a result of relative proximity to earth, these colonies also hold the lion's share of extra-terran industries.
Despite or perhaps because of the stadard of living in these colonies, non of them are self-sustaining. They have, however, been a profitable venture for more than a century.

The core world Colonies fill a multitude of roles. Most of these colonies, especially Luna, excel at production and manufacturing, relying mostly on materials delivered from mars and the subsidiaries of the CERES foundation but also on a considerable influx of materials from further laying mining operations.
Phobos, one of the moons of mars, is the main scientific research hub for the federation navy. Luna, sporting the first of humanity's Zero-G shipyards, are still the premier providers of starships in the solar system, especially for the federation navy. 

Trade and travel between the colonies are very common and accessible.
These trade and travel routes are safe and well established, protected by the federation navy ships' presence and the sheer volume of traffic.
