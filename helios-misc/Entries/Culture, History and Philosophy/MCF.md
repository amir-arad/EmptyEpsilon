# Movement of Colonial Freedom (MCF)

The MCF are a clandestine organization comprised of defectors and deserters as well as criminal elements. These rag-tag elements, each in it's way, strive to undermine the Federation and the day to day life of it's citizens and civilians.


## History

The MCF origin is in the Second Revolt and it's aftermath. Even though many officers have surrendered and were trialed, some executed, this signaled to those still at large that surrender may not be the ideal choice for them, given their part in the fighting.

## Present Day

These rouge captains and their subordinates are the backbone of the MCF to this day.
Operating out of ilegal facilities out in the fringe and outside of the Federal reach, the MCF owns several science, mining and industrial facilities around the Kuiper Belt, hidden by the sheer number of objects in the sector.
