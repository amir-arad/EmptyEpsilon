# Space Raiders

The identity of the first space raider is not known to mankind. The first raid on the then fledgling colony on phoebe, however, has recorded well armed marauders and practiced teamwork, up to and including tactical co-ordination. It has been corroborated later that raiders have been responsible to at least some of the lost space stations. 

Despite the early success of this first effort and the ability of illegal communities to produce more space vessels, there are fewer raiders than pirates, since the extended time involved in a raid and the higher ratio of attacker to victim has allowed a higher percentage of raiders than pirates to be caught. Still, between the unregistered settlement, raiding is more common both because of the lessened chance of reinforcement and the lower population base per settlement. 

At the present day, space raider attacks against sanctioned colonies are dwindling, yet the possibility still exists, prompting the federation navy to guard colonies and convoys and assign ships to patrol and reconnaissance operations.
