# The First Space Pirate

After the first unsanctioned private space colonies and facilities were set up in the asteroid belt beyond mars, hiding its presence inside that astrological feature, it took little time for unsanctioned small ships to start building. In what seemed like no time, the old ugly human habit of vessel interception was rediscovered, with some of those uncensured ships armed and launch into the solar system with greed in their occupants hearts. 

The first pirate has been born, and his name was Xiao "the Rabbit" Jie. 
The Rabbit's career was neither long nor illustrious, as he has been caught and arrested after his second act of space piracy, but media attentions and mass-entertainment populist romantization has imprinted his name into the popular consciousness. Yet, regardless of the public perception of space piracy, the genie has been let out of the bottle and soon enough other enterprising spirits started following suit.
