# Junkers

Just about any bunch of random space-heads with their own spaceship can dissapear these days considering Jump Drive tech and others hit the free market under certain regulations. Junkers take this ticket out of the federated contract and try and use the fact that a vast majority of everywhere is, well, empty. You can hide anywhere and so long you have voletiles and something to eat, no one is bound to find you.

A disproportionate amount of junkers suffer from long-term enclosure mental disabilities and tend to respond unkindly to communications from the outside world. Paranoia, loneliness and space-sickness can turn an already borderline personality into a completely unsociable person. 
Piracy is common among junkers and the larger ‘Crews’ have been known to try and pack on
trading locations in order to secure valuable scrapes.
