# Non Federated Elements

The first thing to realize about the entirety of this group is that the single comparable attribute between them is that they do not accept the authority of the Federation and wish to establish some other society or even simply be unbound by any law at all. As such these are dissidents, malcontents and outright criminals that seek to escape the consequences of their actions.

Three distinct groups of Non Federated Elements have arisen in the years of humanity in space - though over three hundred different groups have been recognized in efforts to stymie their effects on the stability of Federated affairs.

The most openly opposing groups that military personnel should be aware of:

* Rusters - Martian Tribal Gangs
* Junkers - Various individuals and groups that have elected to live in deep space
* Fringers - Population of The Fringer
* Secessionists - Any individual that supports colonial independence
* Undesirables - Organized crime, individuals convicted of corruption
* Pirates - Any group or individual engaged in hijacking, robbery or armed assault against unarmed vessels
* Raiders - Any group of individuals engaged in raiding, marauding, attacking or pillaging civilian facilities
* MCF - Movement of Colonial Freedom. A terrorist organization fueled by the hatred of the federal way of life
