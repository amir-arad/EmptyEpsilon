# Rusters

A native Martian group of humans urging for greater autonomy of Martian Colonies. Originating at the First Revolt and simmering under the surface. Moving about the martian surface with large trucks with heavy radiation shielding - the Rusters are often blamed whenever something goes wrong in a remote outpost.

Tensions are rife with this particular nomadic, largely undocumented population. 
They have relatives in any major settlement and most are, by and large, federated citizens with standard records. Sentiments are still rather harsh, ever since the first revolt and up unto modern days. 
A ruster's radiation-bleached cawl with the rusty red dust around the shoulders still makes most people tense.
