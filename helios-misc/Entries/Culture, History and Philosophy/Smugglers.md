# Smugglers

Closely tied to the rules and regulations of sub sectors within the federation - since governance varies radially between sub-sectors some citizens had taken to using space-faring delivery of contraband materials. Scordite, tainted, dirty or otherwise as well as other rare ores or minerals remain a target for piracy and smuggling efforts.
For the most part, the Federation Navy supports the efforts of all other arms in governance to reign in the smugglers - but space is rather massive, empty and hard to monitor at all times. Thus a concerted efforts to track and deal with havens for smugglers tends to be the answer for such activities.
Other materials, such as sensitive schematics and hard-to-produce prototypes are often dealt with smuggling - corporations engaged in espionage wars often employ underhanded couriers which are often operating on the borders of the local laws regarding the sort of cargo and tariff regulations.
