# Reunion Station

Reunion station was a dead-space installation commissioned in the year 2259 as an unsanctioned and illegal facility, outside of Federal jurisdiction. Reunion Station served as a free port for all travelers, however, de facto was home to many pirates and outlaws seeking to find refuge from Federal reach. Among the inhabitants of the station were men and women of all ages that have come to find themselves at the edge of human civilization.

Reunion station was ultimately used as the MCF headquarters during The Fringe War. The Station was destroyed as a result of a large battle. The rebel forces in the station threatened use of a disproportionate weaponry. The Federation Navy has responded, dispatching a fleet. After all attempts by the Federation to negotiated were rejected by the terrorists, deadly force was applied and a battle ensued. The loss of life was in the tens of thousands.
Several Federation officers were awarded medals for the ultimate destruction of the station, contributing to bringing the war to an end.
