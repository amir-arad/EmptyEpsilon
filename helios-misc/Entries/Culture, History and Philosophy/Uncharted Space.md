# Uncharted - the OORT and beyond

The uncharted, commonly referred to as the Reach or the OORT cloud is extremely empty compared to the short distances inside the solar system - starting around 50 thousand AU and moving up to true interstellar space and into the milky way galaxy proper. Parted to the Hills Disk with some icy bodies floating in that space. Charming place and very very cold that far out from sunlight. Current missions into the OORT and Reach are often experimental in essence and of course - with plentiful space, abundance of water but rarity of materials - swarm fleets and various space stations are located there. 
Often, such deep-reach vessels are so far out direct communications and support they are literally outsiders to main human civilization, branching out in their own social directions as dictated by the various pressures and necessities of living this far out of the light of Sol.
