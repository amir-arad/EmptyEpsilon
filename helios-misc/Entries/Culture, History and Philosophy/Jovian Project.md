# The Jovian project

The Jovian project was a massive, joint federal-corporate colonization effort to colonize 6 of the Jovian moons. Six one way colony ships, launched in three waves, doubled as transportation and first colony habitats. The six colonies compose the Jovian neighborhood, a series of interconnected colonies composing one massive, near-simultanious exudos to the stars.

The six colonies were set up as a main population planet, a mineral mining planet, an oxygen and water mining planet, two transper point planetoids in opposing orbits around Jupiter and a small ship production center.


## Celestial Objects of the Jovian neighborhood:

### Europa (est. 2195), Federal Holding - Most oxygen rich moon around jupiter, settled in the first wave of the jovian project to grant access to large quantities of life supporting substances.

### Io (est. 2195), Corporate Holding - Most volcanically active moon, an experimental colony built on shock absorbant stilts to allow easy access to surface scordite deposits.

### Callisto (est. 2195), Corporate Holding - The most easily populated of the jovian colonies, settled to allow a greater number of people to form the population base of the jovian project.

### Sinope (est. 2196), Federal Holding - transfer point sinope is a cargo and personel transfer point, a giant storehouse and dock that allows starships to dock with it. In effect a giant space station, though it's surface is not entirely covered. Retrograde orbit.

### Elara (est. 2196), Federal Holding - transfer point Elara is a cargo and personel transfer point, a giant storehouse and dock that allows starships to dock with it. In effect a giant space station, though it's surface is not entirely covered. prograde orbit.

### Eukelade (est. 2197), Corporate Holding - Corporate small spacecraft manufactoring colony, built on a tiny planetoid in order to facilitate easily increasing the number and quality of the ships required for the juvian nighboorhood colonies to have an interdependant economy.
