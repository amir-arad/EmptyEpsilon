# The Tri-Nebula

In the year 2059, during the first boom of Scordite Tritanium processing, a terrible accident has occured.
The Tritanium distillary complex placed beyond mars's moon, Phobos, has gone super critical. Post accident analysis has been inhibited by the total and catasrophic destruction of the entire complex, resulting in the creation of the navigational hazard called the tri-nebula.
In a decisive legislative act, the federal senate has declared all future manufactoring of Tritanium to be handled by the federal government in the interest of preservation of human life and prevention of causing future navigational hazards in the solar system.
