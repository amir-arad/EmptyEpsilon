# The Tamel

The Tamel accident is the common name for the collision of the Garat, a Selucia corporation owned vessel, and the Tamel school transport. 

In November 2290, as the Garat, a Science Exploration ship of the Selucia Corporation, was heading out of Ceres, bound for what was supposed to be a short and routine information  collection mission, it collided with a student transport vessel, carrying7 crew members and 77 children and faculty from the Tamel school on Luna, that were heading for Ceres for a class trip.

In what is considered to be in one of history's most infamous space-travel disasters, the impact between the heavily packed science ship and the slow and bulky transport resulted in multiple casualties.it is believed that 27 children on board the transport were killed instantly from the impact, as well as all 15 crew members of the Garat, including captain Peter Scotts. 8 more children passed away from the injuries they sustained, before the rescue ships could reach the wreckage. 

The incident and its aftermath were heavily covered by the news media. While the rescue efforts were commendable, and 42 children and adults were taken off the Tamel transport alive, the cause of the collision between the Garat and the transport generated much interest in the media and many lawsuits. Largely because of an out-of-court settlement agreement between the Selucia corporation with the family members of 28 of the children killed in the accident, during hearings immediately after the disaster. Eventually, an agreement with the remaining 6 families of the Tamel casualties was also achieved and the entire case was settled out of court.

An investigation as to the cause of the accident later determined that the cause of the collision was the accidental malfunction of the Garat’s reactor, resulting in an explosion that severely impaired their ability to navigate. Salvaged records from the Garat suggested that the swift and decisive actions of captain Scotts and his crew, while costing them their lives, have no doubt saved many people as the original course of the science vessel would have caused it to hit the transport in a way that would have undoubtedly caused a massive hall breach and would have caused the loss of life of every man, woman and child on board. 

As a result of the accident, Selucia corporation have greatly updated it’s safety protocols, and have initiated several precautions to ensure that a single point malfunction could no longer cause such a catastrophic result. Despite the published findings, and the steps that were taken, many theories have been featured in multiple news feeds, suggesting the malfunction of the reactor was not an accident, but a deliberate sabotage directed at both the Selucia Corporation and captain Scotts, which had notably one of the fastest advancements in rank within the corporation.
