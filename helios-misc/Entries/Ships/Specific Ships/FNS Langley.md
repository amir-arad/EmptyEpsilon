# FNS Langley

Comissioned on November 23rd, 2266, FNS Langley (CV-1/AV-3) was the Federation Navy's first Jump Capable Carrier, a product of a long standing dreadnaught conversion project by the federation navy. Conversion of another dreadnaught was planned but canceled when the Washington Naval Treaty required the cancellation of the partially built Lexington-class dreadnaughts Lexington and Saratoga, freeing up their hulls for conversion to the aircraft carriers Lexington and Saratoga. Langley was named after Samuel Pierpont Langley, an American aviation pioneer.


## Loss of the FNS Langley

The Langley was the first capital ship in service to be equipped with a Jump Drive. On January 7th, 2268 and despite seemingly smooth operations since the ships commission, the ship was lost to an explosion caused by an unknown complication in the jump drive systems, taking the lives of all on board as well as damaging several other navy and civilian vessels.
A nearby docking facility was also destroyed in the incident.
The incident left over 4000 dead and twice as that injured.

An investigation that followed the incident revealed that the overload of the jumpdrive could have been prevented by multiple officers on the ship, at varying stations. It appears that non of the key positions (The Drive Core, The Bridge Engineering Station, The Electronic Warfare Control Station) were manned or correctly controlled at the time of the incident, however, the reason remains unknown.
