# FNS Gogol

Comissioned on August 17th, 2161, FNS Gogol (MV-116/AV-55) was a mining ship deployed to the Ceres Sector by the Federation Navy Logistics Command. With 75 souls on board and a rather safe route, the Gogol served as an outstanding performing vessel for 3 years until it's loss to an accident on December 21st, 2164.


## Loss of the FNS Gogol

AT 1507 SET, on Sunday morning, December 21st, 2164 disaster struck. Several insecure harnesses in the hangar bay cause cargo to move, resulting in a severe weight shift and breaching the hangar doors as a result.
The sudden depressurization caught the crew of guard, many of whom were experiencing a vacum without any protective equipment and had died before containment was possible.

Federation Navy investigators believe that the compromise of hull integrity had caused the automated navigation systems to compensate, while the collision detection computer was not online - possibly due to damage from the hull breach - resulting in the ships course changing directly into Belt object 582c-94X in the Ceres Sector.
No survivors were found. Final casualty report stated 69 KIA and 6 MIA, presumed dead.
