# FNS Vladimir 


Comissioned on June 26th, 2111, FNS Vladimir (EF-62/AD-68) was one of 52 medium frigate-hull mining ships comissioned by Federation Navy for the purpose of scordite extraction and transportation to foundaries on Mars.
Built mostly as spars around a main engine to allow for multiple loads be attached and detached with ease.
Fielding an experimental, yet assumed-stable, warp drive for commercial usage.




## Loss of the FNS Vladimir


Crew: 27 Rank and File.
Contact list on November 13th 2114.
Possible reasons for the vanishing of the Vladimir, only to arrive back radar around triton, then fade away again are a source of constant rumor. However there is a standing order for the Navy for sightings of the now famous ghost ship. The FNS Vladimir, if nothing else, carried a huge payload of Scordite Elements and the warp drive is requested for further examination.
