# Battleships

Size Class: 6

A battleship is a large armored warship with a main battery consisting of high-end ordnance and advanced command-and-control systems. 
Battleships these days are split between Carrier Ships designed to host swarms of fighters and Ships of the Line, designed to be, in essence, gigantic weapon platforms 
traversing space, using their bulk and enormous gunnery systems to outfight and outlast any and all opposition.
