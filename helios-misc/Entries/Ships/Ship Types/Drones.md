# Drones

Size Class: 0

Drones are the workhorse of anyone that doesn't want to space-walk too much. 
They have trillions of uses and can often be modified on the fly by any ship larger then a corvette to specifically be used to some new function. 
Often deployed in teams to take advantage on the superior numbers and multi-direction sensor arrays, resulting in an a unit that can achieve quite a few tasks of relative complexity in a short period of time.
