# Frigates

Size Class: 3

Frigates are the hard working sluggers of any fleet. This category encompasses anything from a repair-ship trucking along, attack vessels of median size that can work with Destroyers in tactical engagements and even lynchpins for corvettes and fighters to work with. A frigate can be designed for nearly any combat role, and often are tasked with even more.
