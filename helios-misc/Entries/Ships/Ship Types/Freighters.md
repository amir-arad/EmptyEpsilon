# Freighters

Civilization ships that can be used for many applications, mining, transport, etc.
Mostly used for bulk shipping, either of people or for goods. 
Freighters have very little in the way of military-grade of anything, but they do have excellent shielding and often very large storage spaces.
The workhorse of the trade, built in shipyards all around the Solar system is based off the Jinâ€™Dau Corp. Designs.
