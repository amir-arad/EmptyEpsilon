# Federal Marine Corps

The Federal Marine Corps is a branch of the Armed Forces of the Sol Federation.


## Mission

The purpose of the Federal Marine Corps (sometimes referred to as "The Marines" or "The Corps") is to serve as the main expeditionary ground force of the federation.

The Federal Marine Corps may also be used to further and advance various technological, scientific, social, humanitarian and economic interests of the federation.


## History

The Federal Marine Corps was formed on Nov. 27th, 2037, shortly after the establishment of the first off-world colony on Luna. Upon foundation, this armed branch of the Armed Forces of the Sol Federation (AFSF) was lead by General Robert R. Henix. He remained in command until his retirement.


### Origins

The Federal Marine Corps was founded by the Federal Administrative Committee under the understanding that Luna is only the beginning of the human colonization of the near-space.
With the successful establishment of the Luna Colony, it was easy to imagine the future colonization efforts throughout the core worlds of the solar system.

Based on such projections and calculations, the committee decided that some form of armed force or branch of an armed force may be required to provide safety, security and aid to civilians operating and traveling to or between federal or colonial facilities and surface facilities.


## Present Day

At present, a Marine detachment is present on most large vessels of the Federation Navy.
These dettachments serve both as added security and support the ship logistically whenever ground ops are required.

The Federal Marine Corps is also responsible for security on some of the Federations further colonies, where populations are prone to disorder or discontent.
