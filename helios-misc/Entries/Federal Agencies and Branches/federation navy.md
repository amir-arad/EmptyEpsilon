# Federation Navy

The Federation navy is a branch of the Armed Forces of the Sol Federation.


## Mission

The purpose of the Federation Navy (sometimes referred to as "The Fleet" or "Federal Navy") is to safeguard and protect the Federation, it's sovereignty, it's space and it's colonies, as well as Earth itself.
The Federal Navy may also be used to further and advance various technological, scientific, social, humanitarian and economic interests of the Sol Federation.

## History

The Federation Navy was formed on Nov. 13th, 2037, shortly after the establishment of the first off-world colony on Luna. Upon foundation, this armed branch of the Armed Forces of the Sol Federation (AFSF) was lead by Admiral Beaux Hall. He remained in command until his retirement.

For the first 20 years of it's existence, the Navy was mostly comprised of light craft and was not capable of armed engagements outside of the atmosphere. The discovery of Scordite ore and Tritanium alloys c.2057 allowed for construction of larger and more capable vessels capable of conducting warfare in open space.

### Origins

The Federation Navy was founded by the Federal Administrative Committee under the understanding the Luna is only the beginning of the human colonization of the near-space.
With the successful establishment of the Luna Colony, it was easy to imagine the future colonization efforts throughout the core worlds of the solar system.

Based on such projections and calculations, the committee decided that some form of armed force or branch of an armed force may be required to provide safety, security and aid to civilians operating and traveling to or between federal or colonial facilities.

### Reform

The first reform, nicknamed "The Scordite Reform", took place in 2058. It was ordered by General Douglas L. Furst and validated by multiple Federal Committees.
The reform dealt largely with the procurement of resources - namely Scordite - for the purpose of constructing Naval facilities in various undisclosed locations in the solar system.
As part of this reform, approximately 60% of all Scordite procured by any branch or agency of the Federation will be handed over to the possession of the Navy.
Some of the more famous facilities built during these reform include the Lunar Shipyards as well as many of the Stations orbiting the Earth.
This reform also allowed the Federation Navy to produce warships capable of engagement in open space. However, due to their sheer size, these ships are unable to land on planetary surfaces or enter an atmosphere, at all.
