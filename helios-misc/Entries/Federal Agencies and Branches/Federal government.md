# The Federal Government

Headed by the president of the Sol federation, the federal government is a professional institute of lifelong career servants of the pan-national public.
These devoted men and women supply the institutional memory and accumulated experience of millenia. The daunting feat of running an efficient federal government responsible for the prosperity of an entire solar system is well met with vision and consistency.
The Federal Government is divided into departments, sections and subsections. These are headed by ministers and magistrates appointed by the President.


## The President

The President is the commander and chief of the Federation of Sol.
A title bestowed upon a Chief of Staff, 5 Star General, upon completing his term as such. The Presidential term overlaps that of the Chief of Staff and so the transitions between offices are always synchronized.
After having served a term as president, the general retires.


## Prime Minister and Ministers

The Prime Minister is the chief coordinator of government branches, authorities, ministries and ministers. The PM is appointed by the Senate.
Ministers are appointed by the Prime Minister and approved by the President.


## The Judiciary

The Judiciary  is divided into many courts and circuits. It is a powerful entity and has the authority to investigate anything and anyone it sees fit. The higher echelon of the Judiciary is involved in the process of confirming new Senators.


## The Federal Senate 

The Federal senate is populated with the greatest and noblest of the former members of the Continental Parliaments. Elected from those bodies of august statesmen, The Federal senate is, perforce, a body that wields the greatest concentration in history of wisdom, gravity and experience. This body of people legislates carefully and with forethought the federal laws that comprise the baseline legislation implemented across the solar system. This solid bedrock of justice and sagacity is the font from which all laws of districts, states and colonies are derived. These sub-entities then layer and expand on these laws with their own laws, creating the specific environments that empower their chosen way of life.


## The Armed Forces of the Sol Federation (AFSF)

Especially important are the Federal armed forces, bringing peace and security to even the farthest of mankind's' colonies. The long distances and difficulty in communication over the vast solar distances has given birth to an independent, responsibility shouldering community of starship captains, a tradition treasured and encouraged by the federal government, which has bore ample fruits over the centuries of man's migration to the stars.
