# Duties and Shifts

Generally, all duties and responsibilities on a vessel are divided into shifts in order to ensure that each crew member has ample time for his personal needs, such as sleeping, eating or engaging in extracuricullar activities.


## Shift Guidelines

While the Federation Navy provides guidelines, actual shifts and their rotations are largely determined by each vessels commanding officer, as long as minimum requirements of the Navy are met.

* The length of a standard bridge / ECR shift should not exceed 2 hours. Any exception must be approved by the CO or XO and logged in the Deck Log Book.
* While not on shift, crew members are still expected to participate in ongoing activites and operations on the ship, such as cooking or maintenance duties.
* Each crew member is entitled to 8 SET hours of rest out of each 24.
* Shifts are subject to interruption by Yellow or Red Alerts, off duty crew should never be unprepared to go on shift.
* The CO or XO may change, adjust, modify or augment the shift schedule based on operational requirements.


## Shift Change

* A shift change can occur only during Green Condition.
* The BOoW must be present on the bridge 15 minutes prior to shift change for shift handover.
* The BOoW signing off is to collect all relevant data from all manned stations and deliver it to the BOoW assuming command.
* All log entries from the shift must be reviewed by the BOoW assuming command.
* Upon arrival at the bridge fresh shift is briefed by the BOoW which has now assumed command.
* Briefing should include review of the current mission objectives and any current obstacles or expected difficulties.
* The tactical officer signing on must review the current state of arms and munitions on board as well as the readiness state of the vessels weaponry.
* The shift signing off may only leave the bridge once dismissed by the commanding officer.
