# Executive Officer (XO), (Senior Officer)

The XO is the right hand of the captain. 
When the captain is away, the XO has authority over the vessel. Should the Captain no longer be able to carry out his duties, the XO is expected to elevate himself to the CO position and nominate a new XO.

The XO is responsible for manpower assignment and crew discipline. Often times, the XO is placed in charge of logistics operations or tasking coordination.

Executive officers are normally seasoned bridge officers that have qualified to and certified by the Federation Navy Officer Academy and were found worthy of command.

After having served as an XO for 5 years, an officer may apply for his own command.
