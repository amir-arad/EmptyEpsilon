# SALUTE Report

The standard format for reporting enemy information is the SALUTE report.
SALUTE is an acronym that stands for Size, Activity, Location, Unit identification, Time, and Equipment.

This format allows for maximum clarity while maintaining maximum bravity, often required in the atmosphere of a command bridge.


### Example

Science Officer: ***Captain, SALUTE Report!***
CO: ***Go ahead***
Science Officer: ***Enemy force, 3 ships - 2 frigates and 1 corvette, bearing 3-5-0 in the nebula, now moving bearing 2-4-0, Pirate Markings, armed with front beams only.***
