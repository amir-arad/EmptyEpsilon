# Mutiny

Mutiny is a criminal conspiracy among a group of people (typically members of the military or the crew of any ship, even if they are civilians) to openly oppose, change, or overthrow a lawful authority to which they are subject. The term is commonly used for a rebellion among members of the military against their superior officers, but it can also occasionally refer to any type of rebellion against an authority figure.

In the Federation Navy, mutiny is considered to be one of the most severe offenses possible and is mutineers are typically judged and sentenced by a special military tribunal.

It is important to note that disobedience, insubordination, undermining or manipulative behavior are not considered, in themselves, to be an act of mutiny. To prove an act of mutiny the key evidence is proving a conspiracy taking place against a lawful authority.
