# Captain (CO), (Senior Officer)

Not to be confused with the Captain rank, a ship captain is the Commanding Officer (CO) of a vessel.
Often times, the captain of a vessel will also hold a Captain rank, although some Navy Commanders also serve as captains of smaller vessels or orbital facilities.

Final authority on all matters on board and pertaining to the ship is with him.
This authority may be delegated down the chain of command to the Executive officer (XO).

Ship captains are normally experienced officers that have served as Executive officers prior to attaining their own command.
Recieving command of a navy vessel also requires qualification to and certification at the Federation Navy Officer Academy.
Following rigorous training and broad education, these officers become ready to represent the will and spirit of the Federation wherever their ships may fly.
