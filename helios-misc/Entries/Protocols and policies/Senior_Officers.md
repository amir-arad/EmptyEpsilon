# Senior Officers

Senior Officers are the top ranking officers of a vessel.
Most Federation Vessels have 4 Senior officers in different roles:
	* CO - Commanding Officer
	* XO - Executive Officer
	* CE - Chief Engineer
	* CS - Chief of Security

It is imperative that the Senior officers of a vessel have good communication between them as well as the rest of the crew.
Each Senior Officer has his own tasking and responsibilities as well as authority over relevant fields.
