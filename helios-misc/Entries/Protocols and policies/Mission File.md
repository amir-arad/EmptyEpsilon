## Mission Briefing

Mission briefings are a summary and presentation of a mission file to the personnel involved in it's execution or support. Each mission file should include a documented mission briefing in addition to the above documentation.


## Delegation

A Commanding officer may delegate the preparation of the mission file to a competent officer under his command. The Commanding officer is still required, in such cases, to sign off on the mission file and carry the responsibility for it's success or failure.
A Senior officer may delegate the briefing of personnel to a junior officer in training if it is percieved not to hamper the process.
