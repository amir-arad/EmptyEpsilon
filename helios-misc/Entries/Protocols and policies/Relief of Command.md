# Relief of a Commanding Officer by a Subordinate

It is conceivable that most unusual and extraordinary circumstances may arise in which the relief from duty of a commanding officer by a subordinate becomes necessary, either by placing the commanding officer under arrest or on the sick list. Such action shall never be taken without the approval of the Chief of Naval Personnel, as appropriate, or the senior officer present, except when reference to such higher authority is undoubtedly impracticable because of the delay involved or for other clearly obvious reasons. In any event, a complete report of the matter shall be made to the Chief of Naval Personnel, as appropriate, and the senior officer present, setting forth all facts in the case and the reasons for the action or recommendation, with particular regard to the degree of urgency involved.

In order that a subordinate officer, acting upon his or her own initiative, may be vindicated for relieving a commanding officer from duty, the situation must be obvious and clear, and must admit of the single conclusion that the retention of command by such commanding officer will seriously and irretrievably prejudice the public interests. The subordinate officer so acting

1. Must be next in succession to command.
2. Must be unable tn refer the matter to a common superior for the reasons set forth in the
preceding paragraph.
3. Must be certain that the prejudicial actions of the commanding officer are not caused by instructions unknown to him or her.
4. Must have given the matter much careful consideration, and have made such exhaustive
investigation of all the circumstances as may be practicable.
5. Must be thoroughly convinced that the conclusion to relieve the commanding officer is one which a reasonable, prudent and experienced officer would regard as a necessary consequence from the facts thus determined to exist.
​

Intelligent, fearless initiative is an important trait of military character. It is not the purpose of these regulations to discourage its employment in cases of this nature. However, because the action of relieving a senior from command involves most serious possibilities, a decision to do so, or to so recommend, must be based upon facts established by substantial evidence, and upon the official views of others in a position to form valid opinions, especially of a technical character. An officer relieving his or her commanding officer, or recommending such action, together with all others who so counsel, must bear the legitimate responsibility for, and must be prepared to justify, such action.
