# Involuntary isolation

Involuntary isolation is the physical imprisonment or restraint of an individual that has presented a threat to others or himself. Involuntary isolation can be used as a penal measure or as a protective measure, although often the prior and infrequently the latter.

Involuntary isolation takes place only under orders from a Senior Officer but executed by the Security officer.
Normally, detainees are isolated in the Brigg.


## Detaining and Arresting

Detaining an officer, enlisted serviceman or a civilian takes place in extreme situations and must be done with great care for the well being of the detainees.
When detaining individuals, it is important to adhere to these regulations, enforced by the Federation Navy:

	1. The CO must be notified of the Involuntary isolation taking place.
	2. The detainee must be examined by the ship doctor and be found fit for isolation.
	3. In case the detainee is a danger to himself, he must be relieved of his shoes, belt and any other object that may be used for self harm.
	4. In case the detainee is not a crew member, he should be transfered to Federal Authorities at the next station or facility the ship is going to dock at.
	5. Food and water must provided to the detainee in a timely fashion and in a respectful frequency.
	6. The detainee must be allowed access to sanitary facilities.
	7. A detainee may leave the brigg only while escorted and only in case of operational need or under orders from the CO/XO.
	8. The detainee must be checked on every quarter of an hour.
	9. If the detainee is a crew member, it is mandatory that the detainee is court-martialed by the commanding officer within 30 minutes of his imprisonment or isolation.
		9.1 And exception to the above may apply if the detainee is in a medical condition that renders him unable to attend his court martial or if the Ship is under Yellow or Red Alert.
	10. The beginning and end of the isolation must be documented in the Deck / Bridge Log Book.
