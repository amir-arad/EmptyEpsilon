# Combat Briefing

Combat briefing is done before any engagement or change in plans. All manned stations must be aware of the current sitaution as well as foreseen situation. A combat briefing will most times include some form of plan and division of roles, prioritization of tasks or details pertaining to timing, navigation or other aspects of warfare.

A good combat briefing answers the following questions before they are asked:
1. Where should the ship be moving?
2. How Fast should the ship be moving? For how long?
3. What weapons or armaments should be prepared for deployment?
4. When should they be deployed?
5. What is the target prioritization?
6. What communication channels should be opened and when?
7. What should the engineering department expect?
8. What is the exit strategy in case anything goes wrong, for each station?

While this may seem like a lot of information to relay, correct choice of words and usage of professional terminology can conntribute to bravity and clarity in a significant and impactful way.

Here is an example:

CO:***"Attention on bridge - Combat Briefing. Execute the following on my mark.
Helmsman, set Course - 180, Warp2 until you reach the Nebula!
Weapons, arm all tubes with EMP, Engage once in range. Reload HVLI once missiles away.
Target main enemy vessel's weapons. 
Once their weapons are down, open communication channel to enemy flagship and demand their surrender. In case the CE says too much damage and on my say, set course to 270 and enter Warp3. Questions?"***
