# Bridge Officer On Watch (BOoW)

The BOoW is a licensed bridge officer responsible for managing a bridge shift consisting of basic crew.
These officers are responsible for the smooth operations of the ship under normal conditions.
In case of emergency, the BOoW has authority to declare Yellow or Red Alert at his discretion.
They are likely to be sidelined from command once the XO or CO arrive at the bridge.

During a shift, the BOoW should report any irregularities to the XO.
