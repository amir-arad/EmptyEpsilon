# Log Books

Log books are an effective way to document events taking place on board a ship. Various departments keep their own logs and Senior Officers are expected to be accountable for the accuracy of their logs.
Logs allow the Navy to study the performance of it's ships and personnel and use them to find ways to improve technology and training methods as well as debrief missions or investigate accidents.


## Bridge / Command Deck

The Bridge or Deck Log Books are used to keep track of events and occurences that take place during a shift on the command bridge. This enables a smooth transition of shifts and increases the situational awareness of a fresh shift taking control of the bridge.


## Engine Control Room (ECR)

The ECR normally operates it's own logging due to the specifical technical nature of it's operations. The ECR logs are ultimately under the responsibility of the CE, even if delegated to any other engineering officer. Accurate documentation of the ECR''s operations is critical to familiarization of a junior  engineers comprehension of a vessels internal systems.
