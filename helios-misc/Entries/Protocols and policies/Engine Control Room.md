# Engine Control Room

On a spaceship, the engine control room or ECR is the heart and core of a vessel. To increase a vessel's safety and chances of surviving damage, the machinery necessary for operations may be segregated into various spaces. The engine room is generally the largest physical compartment of the machinery space. It houses the vessel's prime mover. On some ships, the machinery space may comprise more than one engine room, such as forward and aft, or port or starboard engine rooms, or may be simply numbered.

On a large percentage of vessels, ships, the engine control room is located near the bottom, and at the rear, or aft, end of the vessel, and usually comprises few compartments.
