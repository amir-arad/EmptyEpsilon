# Alcohol Policy

Although consumption of alcohol on board is allowed, it is expected that all crew are capable of performing their duties during a routine or emergency situation. Therefor, the Navy has established particular limitations and boundaries for consumption of alcoholic beverages on board space faring vessels.

## On Duty

On duty, crew members are not allowed to have Blood-Alcohol Content (BAC) of more than 0.05%.


## Off Duty

Off Duty, crew members are not allowed to have BAC higher than 0.10%.


## Enforcement

Security officers on board Federation Navy vessels are equipped with and authorized to use a standard breathelizer device in case of suspicion of overconsumption.
A breathelizer test can take place under one of the following conditions:
* Severe safety incident or accident resulting in damage to Federal personnel, property or assets.
* Probable Cause, approved by a Senior Officer.


## Sanctions

In case of documented over-consumption, the superior officer of the crew member in question will be notified.
The crew member will be summoned to a disciplinary hearing and sanctions may be imposed.
