# Deck discipline

There are several imporant rules that must be observed on a command deck at all times.
Failure to observe these rules will cause chaos and confusion on the deck and hamper the CO and other officers in doing their jobs.

Before beginning a conversation or reporting a situation, or making any kind of statement, make sure that the intended recipient of your message is ready to receive it.
For example, if the enegineer wants to deliver a damage report to the captain, he would first decalre that he has a damage report to provide. At this point the commanding officer may either accept the request for the information or delay delay its reception.

In cases of severe emergency where a station percives its information to trump all other information in priority and / or severity, normally the phrase "Break break break" is used. Upon hearing "Break brea break", all non-emergency communications must be reduced to operable minimum so that the emergency or priority communication can take place between the stations and the CO, XO or BOoW.
