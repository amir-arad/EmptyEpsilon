# Mapkeeping directive

All Federation Navy vessels are required to update the navy database with maps and points of interest encountered at all times while traversing through the fringe or uncharted space.
It is imperative that the senior officers are aware of the ships surroundings. This is easily achieved with proper mapkeeping and frequent SitReps.
