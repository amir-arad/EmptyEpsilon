# Situation Report (SitRep)

A situation report is a dissemination of information to personnel. Often made by the commanding officer or a commanding officer of an away party, these informative reports make sure that ship crews are on the same page and are able to work towards goals even without real time guidance by their superiors.

Ideally, a good situation report is kept brief but rich in information and detail. Bravity is key, details are secondary in importance but are not unimportant.
A long SitRep may cause disfocus or distract crew from their ongoing tasking.

A SitRep should include the following:
1. Identity of the speaker
2. Current Mission Objective
3. Current progress towards Mission Objective
4. Current obstacle, if any
5. Current Ship Condition, personnel condition if applicable
6. Combat briefing if applicable
7. Anmy situation-specific information the commanding officer decides is pertinent

If enroute:
1. Destination
2. Estimated Time of Arrival
