# Nebula

A nebula (Latin for "cloud" or "fog") is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, nebula was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way.

For Space faring vessels, nebulas represent mostly concealemnt of signals and a disturbance to sensors. For these same reasons nebulas may be used by outlaws or bandits to hide ilegal activities.

Nebulas block the ship's long-range scanner. The Science officer cannot see what's inside or behind them, and while in a nebula the ship's radars cannot detect what's outside of it. These traits make nebulae ideal places to hide for repairs or stage an ambush.
