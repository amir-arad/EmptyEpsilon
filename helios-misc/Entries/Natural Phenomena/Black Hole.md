# Black Hole

A black hole is a point of supercondensed mass with a gravitational pull so powerful that not even light can escape it. It has no locally detectable features and appears only on sensors. An object that crosses a black hole is drawn toward its center and quickly ripped apart by the gravitational forces.

A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing, not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape from inside it.
The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.

Space Faring Vessels are to stay as far as possible from these phenomena.
