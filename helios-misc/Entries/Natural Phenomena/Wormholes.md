# Wormholes

A wormhole, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, is a phenomena that connects two points of spacetime. Jump drives operate in a similar fashion, but instead of being created at will, a wormhole occupies a specific location in space. Objects that enter a wormhole instantaneously emerge from the other end, which might be anywhere from a few feet to thousands of light years away.

Wormholes are rare, and most can move objects in only one direction. Traversable wormholes, which are stable and allow for movement in both directions, are even rarer. All wormholes generate tremendous sensor activity, which an astute science officer can detect even through disruptions such as nebulas.
