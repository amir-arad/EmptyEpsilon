# Juan Suarez DaLima

President Juan Suarez DaLima (2151 - 2223), Born on Mars to wealthy metamaterial designers amidst the influenza outbreaks and the the riots that surrounded the ill treatment of local facilities on the martial domed cities in trying to corral and contain the outbreaks. Sent to the prestigious Lunar Orbitals Academy. Switching majors to colonial Law and Social Affairs and taking first into local politics as a unionist party member. 
Despite the Martian birth and perhaps because of his intimate experience with the plight of a plague-besieged dome-city, he sought to further a stricter, stronger federal rule to allow aid to arrive unhindered during times of crisis.
His ascension through the ranks of the federated political maze, complete was slow, with him failing three different runs into major political positions in the federation - finally arriving as a black horse during the surprise-elections of 2218. Undercutting his liberal opposition and stealing many voices due to his militaristic approach and decisive action after years of relatively lenient and suspected corruption in all chambers of federal rule.
With popular vote firmly in hand, Juan turned to enact what was soon named the Suarez Sanctions, enforcing the Federated Charter on a much wider degree then most of his predecessors - calling to extreme sanction on any and all deviation from the Charters. 
At first the regulations were met with acceptance but as time wore on, the Suarez Sanctions gained a vehement counter movement, with radical movements on most colonies now chafing as federal forces replaced locally elected sub-sector leaders. Threats of secession and others followed suit and several drafts for a new Federated Charters have been proposed and denied by the mostly Universalist rule.
Despite multiple death threats and others - mostly following incidents of inappropriate usage of force by Federated Troops - President Juan Suarez DaLima was mortally wounded during a public speech in CERES and declared to have died from his wounds. Perpetrator was caught and shot dead in the chase. The case was closed as Juraya Semedhil was declared a Lone Wolf act. 
Following the murder, presidency was moved to the legal meantime council of the Federated Higher Chamber. Leading to the events finally resulting in the Second Revolt and the final repealing of the Suarez Sanctions.
