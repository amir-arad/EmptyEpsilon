# Ceres

Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, slightly closer to Mars' orbit.
Composed of rock and ice, Ceres is estimated to compose approximately one third of the mass of the entire asteroid belt. Ceres is the only object in the asteroid belt known to be rounded by its own gravity.


## The CERES Foundation

CERES is the single largest material object in the asteroid belt, consisting mostly out of a water-ice layer and a deep rock-core. Globular in shape and pierced through and through with boreholes designed to both supply water and expose the rich veins of rare elements that the Federation had commissioned the CERES Foundation to mine out c. 2141.

The mining activities on CERES itself never were too profitable, but instead, it became a launchpad for expeditions into the asteroid belt and came under the moniker ‘Belt’s Watering Hole’ in the following years.


## Present Day CERES

The surface of Ceres is mostly used for mining and water-recovering facilities while various orbital facilities are used, tethered as they are with simple, low-gravity space-elevators to the dwarf planetoid. The CERES Foundation retains legal rights as a Core Colony within the federation, complete with a representative to the Core Chamber. This voice is often chosen between the many subsidiaries of the CERES Foundation that are the multiple bases active within the asteroid belt banded together as the Belter Mining Unions.

# Earth

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. It is the Capitol planet of the Sol Fedeartion and it's government.


## Earth Politics

The political machine of the sol federation governs the greatest number of people in the history of the universe.

Since the formation of the sol federation, under the auspices of the federation government, peace, enlightenment and equality has been spread around the Earth, with few notable exceptions.


### The Continental Parliments

As designated in the Documents of Formation, each one of the member super-states has the right and duty to elect a representing parliment, which governs the traditional territories of said formar super state, currently known as districts.
These parliments elect the critical nominations to their district and legislate the district's sub-laws, which are subject to federal judicial override by law legislated in the federal Senate.


## Earth Society


### An age of Prosperity

Our present age is the height of human civilization. Mankind's dark ages and socio-economical backsliding is a thing of the past. The colonies of earth and the industry of the great corporations has unlocked our star systems' true economical potential and the posibilities are, litteraly, astronomical.

On earth, the average standard of living is higher then ever before. Life expectency has risen to new records and the greatest threats to the logevity of the average citizen has been extinguished. Cancer and other terminal illnesses are a thing of the past. Even citizens that become bereft of the means to support themselves are granted basic living stipends calculated by their basic income coefficient. Hunger is a thing of the past.

This remarkable feat is accomplished by the beneficent authority of the federal government that manages the taxes collected from the citizenry and the economical entities of the entire human race, re-allocating resources as needed. The federal government also supervises child-birth, to prevent the over-population tragedied of past centuries.


### Age of Enlightenment

Since the abolishment of the old doctrines (also known as the old religions), the greatest sources of tension and strife that have plagued mankind have finally been unmade. Logic, science and reason are the hallmarks of modarn human society.

# Europa

Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is primarily made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an iron and nickel core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is striated by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare.

At just over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter, it is the sixth-largest moon and fifteenth-largest object in the Solar System. Though by a wide margin the least massive of the Galilean satellites, it is nonetheless more massive than all known moons in the Solar System smaller than itself combined. Its bulk density and composition is similar to the terrestrial planets, thanks to it being primarily composed of silicate rock.

Europa has an outer layer of water around 100 km (62 mi) thick; a part frozen as its crust, and a part as a liquid ocean underneath the ice.

The radiation level at the surface of Europa is equivalent to a dose of about 5400 mSv (540 rem) per day, an amount of radiation that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for a single day.


## Europa colony

Established 2195 thanks to the abundance of water and presence of oxygen in it's atmosphere, and despite the high levels of radiation on it's surface, Europa was the first colony founded on one of jupiter's moons, if only by a few monthes. In the first 15 years after it's founding, radiation protection and the limitations it placed on construction was the single most inhibiting factor in the colony's development. 

While the protection afforded by the habitats has been mostly effective, trace amounts of radiation have caused cancer and other ailments among early settlers. This unfortunate by product of the colonizing effort and the inability to completly prevent deaths as a result have given colonists a reputation of truculance, stand-offishness and mutation, all unjustified, as some of the federations best officers and enlisted hail from this small and important colony.

in the 100 year old colony has been since it's founding and still is a prime source of oxygen and water to the other colonies around jupiter, being in effect a supporting colony for the entire juvian stellar neighborhood.

#Luna (Colony)
The first colony established by the Federation, 2037.

The first settlers arrived 5 years after the formation of the Federation - heroes on their way to conquer new, unknown lands, determined to baldly go where only few had gone before.
Luna is the gate to the solar system, and following that – the whole universe, and it was labeled as that from the start.

Builders, scientists, biologist, engineers and military personnel crowded the first shuttles, leaving behind a planet, just beginning to heal from the war that almost destroyed it, ready to take the first steps of humanity in its journey to the stars.
As the entire world watched, Luna was built as a utopia – a place where people from all across the Federation worked together, regardless of origin and religion, to the advancement of the human race.

The huge “Hephaestus” shipyard is building new shuttles and ships, ready to venture off into spaceץ The shipyard was up and running by the end of the first year, and in only a few short years the first domed cities were also operational, providing a home to the people operating the biggest technological endeavor the world has ever seen. Alongside the cities, the terraforming of the domed fields advanced quickly to the point where the colony was able to provide almost half its food requirements by the end of the second decade.

The establishment of the Mars mining colony was an important catalyst for the Lunar economy, and officially marked its place as Earth’s biggest and most accessible space port. By that time the shuttle traffic between Luna and Earth was as routine as the train services were only a few decades previously.

# Mars

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the Red Planet.


## Colony on Mars

The Mars colony was originally founded in 2055.
The new colony was based around mines. Very difficult living conditions meant that the inhabitants were those who chose it as an alternative to incarceration - men and women convicted in non-violent crimes on earth.

Alongside the volunteers, mining corporations sent workers and scientists.
Ordered is maintained by a local Federal garrison.

The discovery of the Scordite ore in several mines on Mars in 2057 greatly increased the investment of the mining companies, who now had a huge financial incentive to get the colony to full functional capacity as soon as possible, resulting in a population surge due to work immigration.


## Spaceport

By 2073, the spaceport and the orbit docking stations were completed. 
Continued shipping on ores to offworld refineries attracted even more life to mars and turned it into a booming trade hub.

The first university on Mars - Olympus Mons University was established at 2072.   
The option of immigration to Mars was still open for non-violent offenders at that point, but was revoked in 2086 after the Tharsis mine riots of 2085 which broke after the colonists’ original claim for veto rights on new colony members was denied.


## Discontent

For the next 70 years or so, the Mars colony had no discernable events. The mines were working steadily, and the OM University was attracting new students, bringing new ideas and fresh blood to the colonyת and developing it further. During that time period more and more voices advocating full Martian autonomy were heard, and the population slowly grew more uneasy with the proceeds from all their hard work going to the federation and the big companies and not to the population.


## The Martian Quarantine

In 2158, one of the new immigrants to Mars was a carrier of a new violent strain of the influenza-virus. This later caused a full-blown outbreak on Mars, infecting about 70% of the population and causing multiple deaths, especially amongst children, the elderly and miners, who were in greater risk of developing lung disease, despite protective measures.

In response to the outbreak, in 2159 the Federation declared a quarantine on the entire colony, hoping to prevent the spread of the virulent strain to other colonies and to Earth. During the quarantine, the stress the colonists endured due to the sickness was aggravated by shortage of food, water and other essentials. This led to the up rise of the Free Mars movement, calling for changes ranging from increased autonomy for the colony to complete emancipation from the Federation.  

Even after the quarantine was lifted in 2160, the voices calling for Martian autonomy grew stronger, and became more militant, especially amongst the younger colonists. A few small riots were suppressed by the local garrison, but the tension remained.
Surviving that year of quarantine, added to the hard conditions of the colony, had made the Martians very proud of their ability to endure, and has strengthen their sense of patriotism, and had caused some prejudice to form against Earth, the Federation and Luna colony.

# Neptune

Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus, which is 15 times the mass of Earth and slightly larger than Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 astronomical units.


## Colony

The misleading name Neptune colony is often enough to make people mistake this successful experiment of social engineering and corporate design to a colony on the actual planet.

Originally marked as Project Triton - the Neptune mission was highly experimental and wholly chartered by three different corporations, literally creating the legal entity known as the Triton Foundation. This singular corporate entity is owned by shares now soundly split between the original owners, still with a majority at the directorate of over eighty percent and the rest is commercial with just over six percent belonging to the public federation.
Mining hyper-conductive-fluids from Neptunes crust and utilizing the immense energy potential of the howling winds at the planet below had become the main export of Neptune. As well as a tourist spot to view the huge blue planet and its various air-dancing performances.


### Planetary Colony

Venusian aerostats have been theorised for more permanent solutions on Neptune but the wholly different problems of heat preservation and accommodating the rapidly changing, stormy weather has made these plans implausible in the near future.


### Local Culture

Currently Triton is a productive, relatively safe watering hole this far out of sol - and since it's corporate legal composition, it's regulated as a corporate sub-sector with slightly wider autonomy range then the regular deviation of style. Mainly, Neptune is a place where libertarian values about the margins of agreement between consenting adults are far wider. 
Drugs - addictive or otherwise, psycho-active treatments, grey-area research and other such subject matters are often well within the rights of personal liberty. As well as a relatively wide allowance to carry and train with personal weapons.


### Local Law Enforcement

The Triton Peacekeepers are well trained and provided for by the corporate leaders and actual crime is quite rare. Though indeed, borderline deeds that would have been a crime anywhere else, including smuggling, are very often done. Sometimes openly.
Many on earth regard Triton with some romanticism of exploratory and frontier vision of some sort of a "wild west" of old. The reality is far, far, less romantic, but old habits die hard and more than one would-be fortune seeker had found themselves broke at the doorstep of the federated offices looking for a way back home.

# Outer Rim Colonies

The outer rim colonies are colonies that are outside the of the near asteroid belt. Most of these colonies were established as part of the Jovian Project and the Saturn Project and most of these colonies are space stations or undeployed colony-ships.
The planetary conditions do not allow for deployment of a colony on the surface, station-colonies are used instead.

Colonies around the solar system fill a multitude of roles. While some colonies excel at production or manufacturing, others procure resources and ship them to other colonies.
Some colonies excel at scientific research that can only take place off-world. Some provide the Zero-G conditions required for the constructions of space fairing vessels.

Within constellations of colonies such as the Jovian Project and the Saturn Project, inter-colonial trade and travel are very common and accessible.
Colonies further away from others normally have other means of sustainability and longevity, mostly technological.

# Phobos

Hardly a significant piece of rock in space - Phobos made a name for itself for being one of the few projects to hollow out and craft an artificial gravity colony on the inside of an asteroid, as opposed to orbital space stations. 
The process of colonizing and hollowing with advanced machinery became somewhat easier with the fact that most of Phobos inner parts were already being fractured by tidal gravitation powers. This proved to be a boon in the effort to redirect and remake the dark moon into an outstanding success.
Now fully colonized and with the inner-space of Phobos partly terraformed, using the outer rocky crust to defend against cosmic radiation while holding two polar spars that extend into space in the largest shipyards outside the Moon - enjoying an influx of raw materials from Mars the same way the Earth supports the Lunar Space dockyards. 
The Phobian civility is unsurprising in its federated leniency. Designed from the inside out as four small, but efficient, sub-sectors despite the tiny populations. Three of the sub-sectors are blatantly Federated in their voting patterns with the Core Sub-Sector being more ambivalent, often attributed to the large Mars-Oriented culture centers.

#Pluto

Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune.
It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered and the latest settelment to reach colony status at the year 2275. 
Pluto is the largest and second-most-massive known dwarf planet in the Solar System, and the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the Sun.
Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small—about one-sixth the mass of the Moon and one-third its volume


##The Pluto Colony

The pluto colony has been settled by federal senate fiat. As pirate and raider activity reached proportions deemed intolerable by the federal senate (as well as the public out-cry in support of the long suffering outer colonies citizens).
The federation navy has been well prepared for this eventuality and swiftly set up a base on the surface of pluto while simultaniously constructing several military space stations in it's orbit.
A veritable exudos of military men and women and their families followed this relocation, bringing the settlement to colony status in record time. 


##Present Day Pluto

While many inhabitants of pluto are service providers for the families and service personnel, the colony's identity is very military oriented. Many of the colony's descendants join the sevice of the federation where they tend to do well in the already familiar surroundings.
Several generations of this cycle have created a military caste of sorts inside the federal military of service dynesties, gifting the federation with their sweat and blood.

The inhabiting of pluto may have not banished piracy from the solar system, but raiding and piracy has been in decline ever since the colony has been established, the citizen of the outer colonies given a much needed respite.
The plutonians are proud of this heritage and justly so.

# Uranus

Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49K, and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water making up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.


## Colony

Colonised in a significant number only after the events of the Second Revolt have resolved themselves.
With the emancipation act legalizing clemency to most rebel forces, there was still a need for a highly secure prison for the most radical elements. At first plans were drawn up to craft a prison spacecraft, but as the project wore on, it became clear a far better returning investment would be done on Uranus's largest moon - Titania.
While there were a few research vessels in orbit of the gas giant, the promise of liquid water and stable area to plant a fully functioning dome-city amidst the craters of Uranus, along with the tiny gravitational pull of the planet - making it possible to craft a fleet of ships designed to mine out the blue giant's higher layers for various materials as well as serve as a base for asteroid mining throughout the many moons and rings of Uranus.


## Local Culture

The relative proximity of many a radical elements, which were released in due time to the local population under supervision made the entire colony into something of a prison and convict mentality. Many ne'er-do-wells migrated there, conflating the problems and making the vote of the subsector clearly anti-federated on most subjects. 
It is considered run-down and ill-managed even at the best of times, with serious injury and even death events not being so uncommon as the repair status of the mining equipment and the domes themselves are at least two degrees below the level bar.
Most federated personnel are advised to stop in Uranus Colony only while on duty and move about in groups of three and more. The Iras Dome is an active prison facility and is governed by the local Garrison Commander.

# Venus

Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days.
It has no natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition.
It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide.


## Colonization

With the invention of the JumpDrive in 2237, the colonization of Venus turned from a highly-professional, deeply experimental field of research into something of a public interest. With the turmoil of the Second Revolt subsiding, colonization efforts were increasing.

Now that shuttling colonists back and forth from the reaches - both core-worlds and outer rim became that much more feasible, A small stream of exploratory souls living in cramped aerostats labs (Floating cities in the dense Venusian atmosphere) turned by 2239 into a complete wave in colonizing efforts testing various technological solutions to the harsh living conditions.

Venus proved to be a harsh planet to tame and to a very high degree remains inhospitable to human life. However, no less the seventeen  AeroStat type of colonies are now stationed in various heights and exploring several special features of the land.

The incredible  abundance of highly active materials that can be obtained from Venus had rendered it a prime testing location for advanced technologies and the home base of the Lansky Combine, headed by the Lansky Family - one of the most influential developers of the core worlds.


## Local Culture

Like any frontier-planet, Venus is just getting it’s grips on the second generation of local-born people. With most colonists arriving either from Mars or Earth with a few specialists from Luna and CERES - one can expect a particularly eclectic mashup.

Social Experts are quick to note that despite the ‘space-station’ quality of the aerostats, with every hole in the bulkheads positioning dangers - travel between aerostats is quick, effective and commonplace. Thus reducing many of the detrimental conditions unique to void-class space stations. That fact aside, most Venusians are known to be quick minded, easy going and very aggressive on their entrepreneurship.

Each AeroStat is fitted with it’s own self-representative system and allowed relatively autonomous rule on civil matters and a healthy rivalry between Venusian ‘Chapters’ as they had come to call themselves is rife and often quite friendly. 
One special note of the local, acid-etching for metallic objects has become some sort of a proud local art form as it often allows for more organic-like final result then most modern methods and some AeroStats boast beautiful outer shells that have been modified with massive acid-etching projects.

# Illegal Substances (Drugs)

Illegal substances are substances which have had limitations legislated regarding their ownership or use by the federation, and are illegal to own, hold, prescribe or use.
A drug is any chemical that affects the human body or mind when it is ingested, respirated, or introduced in any other way.
A psychoactive drug is any drug that affects the brain's chimestry. Most laws against drugs are about psychoactive drugs.

Some controlled substances are allowed if you have a prescription from a doctor.
Other drugs or products are illegal. The most used drugs are not illegal, for example tobacco and alcohol.

List examples of Common or dangrous controlled substances:

-- Tri-Sedarix-Ochtapolin: AKA Red Bear or TSO.
An old but effective combat enhancment drug, homebrewed versions of reduced consistency are still manufactured today.
While the Original drug Raised agression along with reflexes and pain tolerances, The modern, reduced versions manufactured do not improve the user's control and focus.

-- Gianzhapam-Methaline: AKA Miner's Milk.
This liquid drug, when added to water and ingested, induces concentration and wakefullness and hyper-intelligence in users. While extremely effective, the drug does cause long term damage to many brain functions.
This drug is only mildly addictive physically, but pshycological addiction is usually severe, with withrawl leading to depression or suicide.

-- Fethratentanil: AKA Long-life
A controversial drug, a steady theraphy of this substance can increase an aging individual's life expectancy by years, optimally decades. 
While not expensive to manufacture, drug laws have restricted manufature due to the dangers inherent in even slight quality loss.

-- Sytricanotetanil: AKA Strix
A recreational drug distilled from elements found in astroids, this psychoactive drug is in common recreational use.
Despite ease of manufacture and ease of distribution, this drug has not been leagalized by the federation due to it's deletrious health effects when overused.

-- TetraMorphine: AKA T-Morph
This powerful sedative is a part of every medpack and medical institute. Used to relax any type of pain and grant lucidity for as long as possible, this drug is regretably highly addictive.
While injuries justifing the use of TetraMorphine require full doses, a partial dose can be used for reduced effect with a euphoric element, leading to porblems with illegal use.

-- Asphomedanine: AKA Goodbie party
This dangerous psychoactive drug is sometime considered an urban myth. This drug's effects are extreme, both physically and mentally.
This combat works like an extreamly effective combat enhancer. However, the effect doesn't reverse, only increasing, resaulting in the death of the user.
Due to it's only possible intended use, this drug's use in highly illegal and incurs harsh penalties.

Phobos, one of the moons of mars, is the main scientific research hub for the federation navy. Luna, sporting the first of humanity's Zero-G shipyards, are still the premier providers of starships in the solar system, especially for the federation navy. 

Trade and travel between the colonies are very common and accessible.
These trade and travel routes are safe and well established, protected by the federation navy ships' presence and the sheer volume of traffic.

# Dome City

One of the first true achievements of Mars settlement patterns is the Dome City - While earliest colonisations made into great canyons, roofing them over with much the same materials now used in Dome Cities - the idea is simple. Mars cannot be settled on the outdoors - it lacks the magnetic insulation Earth has against cosmic radiation, making any outdoors incursion a dangerous operation in the least.
Dome cities were the solution - representing a measure that allowed the creation of insulated bubbles of human-safe zones on an otherwise uninhabitable planet.
Instead of using rocks and metal to deflect cosmic radiation, most Dome Cities have a mesh of metamaterials woven into the geodesic platform over the city. Thin membrane of ultra-tough Scordite alloys and smart bots to regulate and repair small impacts and material weariness make the dome a superior solution to the cave-ins and relatively claustrophobic interior of mine-cities. Mostly it is lauded for the relative transparency. Dome cities have a weather, of sorts, at least light and dark shifts which the citizens can enjoy.

The high maintenance and complexity of dealing with an open environment often brings harsher, more strict rulings on ecologically harmful behaviours. Most Dome cities are licensed to corporations or even directly managed by them. With such cities often achieving "sub-sector" designation relatively quickly and making their electorate highly diverse.

# The Dreadling Point

Dozens of years before the first spaceborne pirate, a social scientist named Dreadling, theorized a point of technological advancement in humanity's future. That point of a self realized ability of space colonies to independently propagate. Long and acrimonious political discussion between independent propagation proponents and colony control advocates swept the federal political system for years. 
After the victory of the colony control advocates, certain elements of space ship component and technology were declared secret and their construction limited by federal law to the lunar shipyards. 

Just as predicted and argued by the independent propagation proponents, the people in the space colonies developed alternate methods or downright reverse-engineered the necessary tech to allow them to create new colonies of their own. The arrival at the dreadling point was only delayed by a few years.

# First Revolt [2085]

The First Revolt was a conflict between certain elements on Mars and it's moons.
The hostilities were resolved diplomatically.

## Reasons

Today it is understood that the main issue with the Tri-World Revolt was a severe disconnect between the rapidly-developing culture on Mars-based colonies compared to the relatively easy development on the Lunar Colony. In comparison, despite the huge problems that faced the first pioneers at the Lunar SpacePorts - the social composition made it possible to finish construction with minimal stratification. The Mars Colonization Rush ran diametric to this same notion and social stratification skyrocketed. 

Conflated with inadequate leadership at the Martian Corporations compared to the charismatic Prescott Initiative - the First Revolt sought to reform the federation by force and threat of starvation and violence on all sides.


## History

Due to lag in communications and rapidly rising stratification of society - the highly centralized Federated Earth began leaking through the cracks. A noted rise in corruption in various ranks of bureaucracy combined with severe nepotism on the Lunar Colony landed a couple of wildly visible clashes between the central governing body and the localized establishments.


## Hostilities

The rebellion itself was full of terror acts on a scale which was only being tested sixty years ago at the third World War. Starships crashed in city centers, high-visibility assassinations and profile murdering all played part.


## Resolution

Over time, and understanding grew on Mars and it's moons that these colonies, yerning of independence as they may be, are simply not ready for self-sustainability. Dependency on Earth proved to be a problem yet to be solved. This understanding, coupled with the numeric superiority of the federal forces eventually ground the rebelion to a slow halt.

The Fringe is a sector of the Kuiper Belt Objects lying just outside the legal periphery of the Federation and the Solar System.
Too far for comfort, but a steady and sturdy source of volatiles and potable water as well as setting the foot as far from earth as humanly possible in any permanent orbit. Two space-station of fixed orbit have been established formally by Federation-Based corporations, as well as many smaller facilities.

# Illegal Substances (Drugs)

Illegal substances are substances which have had limitations legislated regarding their ownership or use by the federation, and are illegal to own, hold, prescribe or use.
A drug is any chemical that affects the human body or mind when it is ingested, respirated, or introduced in any other way.
A psychoactive drug is any drug that affects the brain's chimestry. Most laws against drugs are about psychoactive drugs.

Some controlled substances are allowed if you have a prescription from a doctor.
Other drugs or products are illegal. The most used drugs are not illegal, for example tobacco and alcohol.

List examples of Common or dangrous controlled substances:

-- Tri-Sedarix-Ochtapolin: AKA Red Bear or TSO.
An old but effective combat enhancment drug, homebrewed versions of reduced consistency are still manufactured today.
While the Original drug Raised agression along with reflexes and pain tolerances, The modern, reduced versions manufactured do not improve the user's control and focus.

-- Gianzhapam-Methaline: AKA Miner's Milk.
This liquid drug, when added to water and ingested, induces concentration and wakefullness and hyper-intelligence in users. While extremely effective, the drug does cause long term damage to many brain functions.
This drug is only mildly addictive physically, but pshycological addiction is usually severe, with withrawl leading to depression or suicide.

-- Fethratentanil: AKA Long-life
A controversial drug, a steady theraphy of this substance can increase an aging individual's life expectancy by years, optimally decades. 
While not expensive to manufacture, drug laws have restricted manufature due to the dangers inherent in even slight quality loss.

-- Sytricanotetanil: AKA Strix
A recreational drug distilled from elements found in astroids, this psychoactive drug is in common recreational use.
Despite ease of manufacture and ease of distribution, this drug has not been leagalized by the federation due to it's deletrious health effects when overused.

-- TetraMorphine: AKA T-Morph
This powerful sedative is a part of every medpack and medical institute. Used to relax any type of pain and grant lucidity for as long as possible, this drug is regretably highly addictive.
While injuries justifing the use of TetraMorphine require full doses, a partial dose can be used for reduced effect with a euphoric element, leading to porblems with illegal use.

-- Asphomedanine: AKA Goodbie party
This dangerous psychoactive drug is sometime considered an urban myth. This drug's effects are extreme, both physically and mentally.
This combat works like an extreamly effective combat enhancer. However, the effect doesn't reverse, only increasing, resaulting in the death of the user.
Due to it's only possible intended use, this drug's use in highly illegal and incurs harsh penalties.

# Illegal Trade

In the federated space trade is relatively easy to conduct - with stable space lanes and moving of information as well as physical goods done in a quick and efficient way since the development and deployment of the jump drive. More archaic ways of delivering goods still exist and since the Federation restricts certain sorts of goods, traffic in them is done in all sorts of black markets.

## Military Grade Technology

Weapons regulations are rather strict around the Federation, with space station ushering even stricter rules over ownership or even possession of a deadly firearm. As such, arms dealers are quiet as hull-rats if at all possible. 
Dealing with irregularly fabricated material. It is suspected that most illegal arms in the solar system arise from certain Junker rings in the asteroid belt but nothing is certain.


## Restricted Medication

Since most drugs are relatively easy to procure and produce - hydroponics and artificial synthesized variants are rife within the lower social stratas as well as several higher-living individuals. Experimental drugs tend to hit the market with promises of enlightenment and higher mental functionality - often with debilitating side-effects.


## Dirty Ore

Illegaly extracted or mined, these ores are possibly tainted or impure, as they have gone through unregulated procedures of procurement.
Ores and minerals mined and extracted in space are subject to federal regulation and taxation, which some individuals deem too high or inappropriate, resulting in a black market of industrial supplies. These unregulated or "Dirty" ores are often processed or refined in illegal refining facilities operated by undesirables.

# The Mimas Spore

The Mimas spore is an aggressive strain of space bourn organism, originally found on Mimas, the moon of Saturn. While the Mimas Spore is actually not of the fungi kingdom, it does share some traits with it, mainly spore-like distribution, from which it gets its name and its common nickname Space Fungus.


## First Encounter

The first encounter of humanity with the Mimas Spore was in 2203, when a research party that landed on Mimas first recognized it, bringing samples to study, without realizing the spores have also found their way onto the ship. The spores quickly spread across the spaceports and are now considered to be present in every spaceport and on every ship.

## Colonization

When close to each other, the Mimas Spores affect each other to multiply in colony form, creating a
rapidly growing gelatinous green/dark green substance.
Undetectable before the colony stage, the Mimas spore is an Electrophilic organism, usually
accumulating on Circuit boards, electric panels, computer servers etc. although it can grow anywhere.


## Effects

When growing on an electronic device, the Mimas Spore can cause rapid decay of circuits and
overheating, frequently causing systems to malfunction.
Until this day it is uncertain if the Mimas Spore is virulent towards humans. It has known to cause severe skin irritations upon contact and in some cases it has been known to cause allergic reactions.
There are no reported cases of specific illness related to the spore. The spore can also use the human skin as habitat and so it is recommended to never touch the Mimas Spore colony without protective gear.


## Handeling

Since currently, there is no way to identify the Mimas Spores before the colonies reach a visually identifiable size, and there is no known way to prevent their spreading, the only way to prevent electronics malfunction is to routinely detect all spore colonies, removing them using specialized tools and storing them in special capsules until disposal via incineration.
Direct exposure should be treated by washing the affected area with warm water and soap for 30 seconds or more.

Scordite is the ore that is processed into Tritanium, the material that makes up the skin and bones of mankind's starships. It's extra-ordinary and absolute resistence to radiataion has allowed advances in propulsion and reactor technology that has propeled the quality of mankind's starships into unimagined highets practically overnight. Since its' discoery and processing into Tritanium, every ship and spacestation in the solar system has been built with this material, at least in it's engineering section and outer hull components.


## Discovery of Scordite

Scordite, as a material, is responsible in many ways to the current shape of human civilization. The discovery of this wonderous ore in the astroid belt beyond mars by a federation science mission in the year 2057. At the time, public discussion regarding the expenses incurred by the grand scale scientific research by the federation government has been active and acrimonious, but the victory of scordite has changed public opinion towards support in research effort for many decades.


### Scordite Mining and Prospecting

While the first batch of scordite was found in the astroid belt, theories regarding the possibility of the existence of scordite inside plants (and even earth itself) has prompted advances in mining practices and scientifically related fields. 
After the first batch of scordite was found inside the earth's crust, prospecting for scordite has spread from spaceships in the astroid belt to corporations and federal backed surveys across planets.
With further advances in ship-building science, smaller and smaller ship becoming feasible, up to and including privately owned ships.
Currently, both astroid belts are alive with miners and prospectors, of any material that is useful to mankind among the stars, and foremost among them is scordite.


### Tritanium Manufacture

Since the great catastrophe of 2059, the federal government has banned all manufacture of Tritanium not occuring in federal refineries. All mnufacturing of Tritanium is handled outside of atmoshpere, in designated refinery stations that are limited in size and intentionaly distanced from one another to prevent the occurence of a chain reaction of the type that created the tri-nebula.

Despite the best efforts of the navy of the federation, dissident elements and black marketeers build secret Tritanium manufactoring facilities, though thankfuly never in the scale of the phobos complex. Since the accident of 2059, there has never been a known example of Tritanium manufacturing facility going critical, and hopefully there never will be.

item:setLongDescription([[
# Second Revolt

The Second Revolt is a term used to describe an armed conflict between the Federation and various rebelious factions vying for increased colonial autonomy.


## Causes

Following the reforms of 2219, legislation was passed to reinstate Federal Governors over local parliaments - also instating a wider control over movement of citizens between colonies.

Many say the first shot was fired nearly a decade before the Second Revolt - when President Joan Suarez Da’Lima died in office.
A thorough investigation blamed a previously undiagnosed heart condition.
Dissenters claimed it was murder for the attempts made in the Higher Chamber to repeal the Peaceful Core Act.


## Backlash and Response

Widespread disregard to due process and Core Values of the Federation caused the disbanding of the local Police office and replaced with Federal Police forces, regulated and governed by the Central Office rather than from the local governing body.

Separatist movements urged larger freedoms in both the Presidential Office and Local Parliaments. Several moves were made to repel the entire Federated Concord and remake humanity into truly separate nations.

Eventually, with public support of separatist movements reaching a boiling point, unending deadlock at the Parliament and utter disregard of the Higher Chamber during years 2234 and up to 2238, the Second Revolt escalated.


## Hostilities

The separatist parties were all political rivals rather than an actual threat to the federation. No army, no field forces, nothing to declare revolt with. For generations, however, most officers and officials tended to come from the inner and outer colonies. A disproportional amount of officers and highly trained personnel had to make the call between Federal loyalties and their home-settlements and colonial families.

An unexpected amount of them chose to remain loyal to home rather than federation. Enough space-faring vessels deserted and defected to make a rebel fleet a real threat.
With so many competent leaders and trained personnel, combined with pirate tactics and guerrilla warfare on all fronts, the Second Revolt was close to becoming a civil war.

Despite their fighting spirit and best efforts, the Federation Navy and it's numbers could not be defeated or deterred.

The butcher’s bill came to tens of thousands, mostly from space-debris crashing into populated areas. Several space stations were reduced to inoperable status during desperate guerrilla fighting.


## Conclusion and Abdication

Four years of grueling reforging of the Federation Navy, including the introduction of the Jump Drive during 2237 - made the war slowly grind to a halt until the Revolt subsided.

The President had abdicated on the whole at the end of the revolt.
Severe punishments were imposed on many of the separatist higher ranking officers - some were executed, some imprisoned, some - pardoned.

While the revolt had gained some of the outer colonies an increased degree of autonomy in the form of local legislation capabilities, it has also brought the Federation Navy, and with it the Federal Marine Corps to all of them - to stay.

# Current day piracy

Despite all attempts to stamp out piracy in the solar system, despite lulls in activity and stretches of intense efforts, pirate attacks have never been fully halted.

## Piracy in the future

Despite valiant and ceaseless efforts for dozens of years, many triumphs and brilliant operations, the federal navy has not managed to eradicate space piracy. This failure, while baffling at first, was easily explained by the Danzky formula. It was proven to be a mathematical impossibility to eradicate independent piracy as long as independent colonization is possible.

It has been corroborated later that raiders have been responsible to at least some of the lost space stations. 

Despite the early success of this first effort and the ability of illegal communities to produce more space vessels, there are fewer raiders than pirates, since the extended time involved in a raid and the higher ratio of attacker to victim has allowed a higher percentage of raiders than pirates to be caught. Still, between the unregistered settlement, raiding is more common both because of the lessened chance of reinforcement and the lower population base per settlement.

The spirit of the federation navy is a binding moral document that has been compiled in order to assist the entire body of fleet personnel in understanding the heirarcy of values required of its' officers and enlisted personnel. In every occrance of a moral or valuative dillema, Fleet command expects its' personnel to act in accordance with the spirit of the federation navy, upholding the values of the federation to the utmost extent. Violating the values of the navy is commensurate with serious military offences and is eligible to be either summarily judged or brought before a military tribunal.

2. Core values:

		2.1 The following values are the foundational values of the federation navy. They are the valuative cornerstone upon which is based the true essence of being an officer or enlisted in the federation navy.

			2.1.1 Duty - Navy service is a privilage that is in effect a moral and valuative duty.

			2.1.2 Courage - The serviceman will always show courage and fighting spirit, either in the face of adversity or in carrying out his routine duties.

			2.1.3 Honor - The federation navy is a military force with a long and distinguished tradition. Every person that dons the federation navy uniform is in effect its representative.

3. Values:

		3.1. Mission adherance - The serviceman will act to carry out one's mission, in accordance with the orders given to him by his superiors, even at the cost of his life.  Mission completion is a value directly derivitive from duty, for it is a serviceman's duty to carry out his mission. 

		3.2. Discipline - "Discipline is nither optional or discretionary". A Serviceman cannot either elect or dispute the laws of discipline. They are the foundational element of being a serviceman.

		3.3. Integrity - the serviceman is expected to embody honesty and integrity, speaking only truth, regardless of possible consequences.

		3.4. Purity of arms and the value of human life - The overarching goal of the federation navy is to protect the citizens of the federation. Therefore navy servicemen will always aspire to avoid unnecceary loss of life, in particular of uninvolved parties. Also, the serviceman will strive to avoid excessive and unneccesary use of deadly force, especially if it not specifically to given orders for its use.
	
		3.5. Personal example - The serviceman will provide a personal example for both outside of (federation citizenry) and inside of (comrades in arms) the service in every possible fashion - Professionally, moraly and valuatively.

		3.6. The serviceman will aspire to maximal proffesionalism in every field. The serviceman will not abide mediocracy and will not be daunted by any challange.

		3.7. Camraderie - Camraderie is the essence of mutual sacrifice the fuels the fighting spirit of every fighting or supporting unit in the navy. Let every serviceman know that the crewman beside him is willing to lay down his life for him.

		3.8. Sacrifice - Every serviceman understands that as a part of the service he will be required to sacrifice an measure of his individuality in order to fortify the service. Sacrifice begins in small gestures and may eventually amount to the ultimate sacrifice.

# The Tri-Nebula

In the year 2059, during the first boom of Scordite Tritanium processing, a terrible accident has occured.
The Tritanium distillary complex placed beyond mars's moon, Phobos, has gone super critical. Post accident analysis has been inhibited by the total and catasrophic destruction of the entire complex, resulting in the creation of the navigational hazard called the tri-nebula.
In a decisive legislative act, the federal senate has declared all future manufactoring of Tritanium to be handled by the federal government in the interest of preservation of human life and prevention of causing future navigational hazards in the solar system.

# The Federal Government

Headed by the president of the Sol federation, the federal government is a professional institute of lifelong career servants of the pan-national public.
These devoted men and women supply the institutional memory and accumulated experience of millenia. The daunting feat of running an efficient federal government responsible for the prosperity of an entire solar system is well met with vision and consistency.
The Federal Government is divided into departments, sections and subsections. These are headed by ministers and magistrates appointed by the President.


## The President

The President is the commander and chief of the Federation of Sol.
A title bestowed upon a Chief of Staff, 5 Star General, upon completing his term as such. The Presidential term overlaps that of the Chief of Staff and so the transitions between offices are always synchronized.
After having served a term as president, the general retires.


## Prime Minister and Ministers

The Prime Minister is the chief coordinator of government branches, authorities, ministries and ministers. The PM is appointed by the Senate.
Ministers are appointed by the Prime Minister and approved by the President.


## The Judiciary

The Judiciary  is divided into many courts and circuits. It is a powerful entity and has the authority to investigate anything and anyone it sees fit. The higher echelon of the Judiciary is involved in the process of confirming new Senators.


## The Federal Senate 

The Federal senate is populated with the greatest and noblest of the former members of the Continental Parliaments. Elected from those bodies of august statesmen, The Federal senate is, perforce, a body that wields the greatest concentration in history of wisdom, gravity and experience. This body of people legislates carefully and with forethought the federal laws that comprise the baseline legislation implemented across the solar system. This solid bedrock of justice and sagacity is the font from which all laws of districts, states and colonies are derived. These sub-entities then layer and expand on these laws with their own laws, creating the specific environments that empower their chosen way of life.


## The Armed Forces of the Sol Federation (AFSF)

Especially important are the Federal armed forces, bringing peace and security to even the farthest of mankind's' colonies. The long distances and difficulty in communication over the vast solar distances has given birth to an independent, responsibility shouldering community of starship captains, a tradition treasured and encouraged by the federal government, which has bore ample fruits over the centuries of man's migration to the stars.

# Federal Marine Corps

The Federal Marine Corps is a branch of the Armed Forces of the Sol Federation.


## Mission

The purpose of the Federal Marine Corps (sometimes referred to as "The Marines" or "The Corps") is to serve as the main expeditionary ground force of the federation.

The Federal Marine Corps may also be used to further and advance various technological, scientific, social, humanitarian and economic interests of the federation.


## History

The Federal Marine Corps was formed on Nov. 27th, 2037, shortly after the establishment of the first off-world colony on Luna. Upon foundation, this armed branch of the Armed Forces of the Sol Federation (AFSF) was lead by General Robert R. Henix. He remained in command until his retirement.


### Origins

The Federal Marine Corps was founded by the Federal Administrative Committee under the understanding that Luna is only the beginning of the human colonization of the near-space.
With the successful establishment of the Luna Colony, it was easy to imagine the future colonization efforts throughout the core worlds of the solar system.

Based on such projections and calculations, the committee decided that some form of armed force or branch of an armed force may be required to provide safety, security and aid to civilians operating and traveling to or between federal or colonial facilities and surface facilities.


## Present Day

At present, a Marine detachment is present on most large vessels of the Federation Navy.
These dettachments serve both as added security and support the ship logistically whenever ground ops are required.

The Federal Marine Corps is also responsible for security on some of the Federations further colonies, where populations are prone to disorder or discontent.

# Federation Navy

The Federation navy is a branch of the Armed Forces of the Sol Federation.


## Mission

The purpose of the Federation Navy (sometimes referred to as "The Fleet" or "Federal Navy") is to safeguard and protect the Federation, it's sovereignty, it's space and it's colonies, as well as Earth itself.
The Federal Navy may also be used to further and advance various technological, scientific, social, humanitarian and economic interests of the Sol Federation.

## History

The Federation Navy was formed on Nov. 13th, 2037, shortly after the establishment of the first off-world colony on Luna. Upon foundation, this armed branch of the Armed Forces of the Sol Federation (AFSF) was lead by Admiral Beaux Hall. He remained in command until his retirement.

For the first 20 years of it's existence, the Navy was mostly comprised of light craft and was not capable of armed engagements outside of the atmosphere. The discovery of Scordite ore and Tritanium alloys c.2057 allowed for construction of larger and more capable vessels capable of conducting warfare in open space.

### Origins

The Federation Navy was founded by the Federal Administrative Committee under the understanding the Luna is only the beginning of the human colonization of the near-space.
With the successful establishment of the Luna Colony, it was easy to imagine the future colonization efforts throughout the core worlds of the solar system.

Based on such projections and calculations, the committee decided that some form of armed force or branch of an armed force may be required to provide safety, security and aid to civilians operating and traveling to or between federal or colonial facilities.

### Reform

The first reform, nicknamed "The Scordite Reform", took place in 2058. It was ordered by General Douglas L. Furst and validated by multiple Federal Committees.
The reform dealt largely with the procurement of resources - namely Scordite - for the purpose of constructing Naval facilities in various undisclosed locations in the solar system.
As part of this reform, approximately 60% of all Scordite procured by any branch or agency of the Federation will be handed over to the possession of the Navy.
Some of the more famous facilities built during these reform include the Lunar Shipyards as well as many of the Stations orbiting the Earth.
This reform also allowed the Federation Navy to produce warships capable of engagement in open space. However, due to their sheer size, these ships are unable to land on planetary surfaces or enter an atmosphere, at all.

# Asteroid Belt
The asteroid belt is the circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.

The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids. About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea.

The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200 km).

The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions.

Individual asteroids within the asteroid belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into four basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), metal-rich (M-type) and scordite-rich (V-type).

Carbonaceous asteroids, as their name suggests, are carbon-rich. They dominate the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% of the visible asteroids.

S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun. They form about 27% of the total asteroid population.

M-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of the total population. It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.

V-type (scordite-rich) asteroids form about 6% of the total population of the asteroids in the main asteroid belt. These asteroid are closely monitored by the federation Navy due to the importance that the navy places on Scordite.

# Black Hole

A black hole is a point of supercondensed mass with a gravitational pull so powerful that not even light can escape it. It has no locally detectable features and appears only on sensors. An object that crosses a black hole is drawn toward its center and quickly ripped apart by the gravitational forces.

A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing, not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape from inside it.
The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.

# Nebula

A nebula (Latin for "cloud" or "fog") is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, nebula was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way.

For Space faring vessels, nebulas represent mostly concealemnt of signals and a disturbance to sensors. For these same reasons nebulas may be used by outlaws or bandits to hide ilegal activities.

Nebulas block the ship's long-range scanner. The Science officer cannot see what's inside or behind them, and while in a nebula the ship's radars cannot detect what's outside of it. These traits make nebulae ideal places to hide for repairs or stage an ambush.

# Wormholes

A wormhole, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, is a phenomena that connects two points of spacetime. Jump drives operate in a similar fashion, but instead of being created at will, a wormhole occupies a specific location in space. Objects that enter a wormhole instantaneously emerge from the other end, which might be anywhere from a few feet to thousands of light years away.

Wormholes are rare, and most can move objects in only one direction. Traversable wormholes, which are stable and allow for movement in both directions, are even rarer. All wormholes generate tremendous sensor activity, which an astute science officer can detect even through disruptions such as nebulas.

Sent to the prestigious Lunar Orbitals Academy. Switching majors to colonial Law and Social Affairs and taking first into local politics as a unionist party member. 
Despite the Martian birth and perhaps because of his intimate experience with the plight of a plague-besieged dome-city, he sought to further a stricter, stronger federal rule to allow aid to arrive unhindered during times of crisis.
His ascension through the ranks of the federated political maze, complete was slow, with him failing three different runs into major political positions in the federation - finally arriving as a black horse during the surprise-elections of 2218. Undercutting his liberal opposition and stealing many voices due to his militaristic approach and decisive action after years of relatively lenient and suspected corruption in all chambers of federal rule.
With popular vote firmly in hand, Juan turned to enact what was soon named the Suarez Sanctions, enforcing the Federated Charter on a much wider degree then most of his predecessors - calling to extreme sanction on any and all deviation from the Charters. 
At first the regulations were met with acceptance but as time wore on, the Suarez Sanctions gained a vehement counter movement, with radical movements on most colonies now chafing as federal forces replaced locally elected sub-sector leaders. Threats of secession and others followed suit and several drafts for a new Federated Charters have been proposed and denied by the mostly Universalist rule.

item = space_objects:addEntry('Chain of Command')
item:setLongDescription([[
# Chain of Command

In a military context, the chain of command is the line of authority and responsibility along which orders are passed within a military unit and between different units. Orders are transmitted down the chain of command, from a higher-ranked soldier, such as a commissioned officer, to lower-ranked personnel who either execute the order personally or transmit it down the chain as appropriate, until it is received by those expected to execute it.

In general, military personnel give orders only to those directly below them in the chain of command and receive orders only from those directly above them. A service member who has difficulty executing a duty or order and appeals for relief directly to an officer above his immediate commander in the chain of command is likely to be disciplined for not observing the chain of command. Similarly, an officer is usually expected to give orders only to his or her direct subordinate, even if it is just to pass an order down to another service member lower in the chain of command than said subordinate.

The concept of chain of command also implies that higher rank alone does not entitle a higher-ranking service member to give commands to anyone of lower rank. For example, an officer of unit "A" does not directly command lower-ranking members of unit "B", and is generally expected to approach an officer of unit "B" if he requires action by members of that unit. The chain of command means that individual members take orders from only one superior and only give orders to a defined group of people immediately below them.

If an officer of unit "A" does give orders directly to a lower-ranked member of unit "B", it would be considered highly unusual (a faux pas, or extraordinary circumstances, such as a lack of time or inability to confer with the officer in command of unit "B") as officer "A" would be seen as subverting the authority of the officer of unit "B". Depending on the situation or the standard procedure of the military organization, the lower-ranked member being ordered may choose to carry out the order anyway, or advise that it has to be cleared with his or her own chain of command first, which in this example would be with officer "B". Refusal to carry out an order is almost always considered insubordination, the only exception usually allowed is if the order itself is illegal (i.e., the person carrying out the order would be committing an illegal act). (See Superior Orders.)

In addition, within combat units, line officers are in the chain of command, but officers in specialist fields (such as medical, dental, legal, supply, and chaplain) are not, except within their own specialty. For example, a medical officer in an infantry battalion would be responsible for the combat medics in that unit but would not be eligible to command the battalion or any of its subordinate units.

The term is also used in a civilian management context describing comparable hierarchical structures of authority.

# Combat Briefing

Combat briefing is done before any engagement or change in plans. All manned stations must be aware of the current sitaution as well as foreseen situation. A combat briefing will most times include some form of plan and division of roles, prioritization of tasks or details pertaining to timing, navigation or other aspects of warfare.

A good combat briefing answers the following questions before they are asked:
1. Where should the ship be moving?
2. How Fast should the ship be moving? For how long?
3. What weapons or armaments should be prepared for deployment?
4. When should they be deployed?
5. What is the target prioritization?
6. What communication channels should be opened and when?
7. What should the engineering department expect?
8. What is the exit strategy in case anything goes wrong, for each station?

While this may seem like a lot of information to relay, correct choice of words and usage of professional terminology can conntribute to bravity and clarity in a significant and impactful way.

For example, if the enegineer wants to deliver a damage report to the captain, he would first decalre that he has a damage report to provide. At this point the commanding officer may either accept the request for the information or delay delay its reception.

In cases of severe emergency where a station percives its information to trump all other information in priority and / or severity, normally the phrase "Break break break" is used. Upon hearing "Break brea break", all non-emergency communications must be reduced to operable minimum so that the emergency or priority communication can take place between the stations and the CO, XO or BOoW.

# Duties and Shifts

Generally, all duties and responsibilities on a vessel are divided into shifts in order to ensure that each crew member has ample time for his personal needs, such as sleeping, eating or engaging in extracuricullar activities.


## Shift Guidelines

While the Federation Navy provides guidelines, actual shifts and their rotations are largely determined by each vessels commanding officer, as long as minimum requirements of the Navy are met.

* The length of a standard bridge / ECR shift should not exceed 2 hours. Any exception must be approved by the CO or XO and logged in the Deck Log Book.
* While not on shift, crew members are still expected to participate in ongoing activites and operations on the ship, such as cooking or maintenance duties.
* Each crew member is entitled to 8 SET hours of rest out of each 24.
* Shifts are subject to interruption by Yellow or Red Alerts, off duty crew should never be unprepared to go on shift.
* The CO or XO may change, adjust, modify or augment the shift schedule based on operational requirements.


## Shift Change

* A shift change can occur only during Green Condition.
* The BOoW must be present on the bridge 15 minutes prior to shift change for shift handover.
* The BOoW signing off is to collect all relevant data from all manned stations and deliver it to the BOoW assuming command.
* All log entries from the shift must be reviewed by the BOoW assuming command.
* Upon arrival at the bridge fresh shift is briefed by the BOoW which has now assumed command.
* Briefing should include review of the current mission objectives and any current obstacles or expected difficulties.
* The tactical officer signing on must review the current state of arms and munitions on board as well as the readiness state of the vessels weaponry.
* The shift signing off may only leave the bridge once dismissed by the commanding officer.

# Involuntary isolation

Involuntary isolation is the physical imprisonment or restraint of an individual that has presented a threat to others or himself. Involuntary isolation can be used as a penal measure or as a protective measure, although often the prior and infrequently the latter.

Involuntary isolation takes place only under orders from a Senior Officer but executed by the Security officer.
Normally, detainees are isolated in the Brigg.

Detaining an officer, enlisted serviceman or a civilian takes place in extreme situations and must be done with great care for the well being of the detainees.
When detaining individuals, it is important to adhere to these regulations, enforced by the Federation Navy:

	1. The CO must be notified of the Involuntary isolation taking place.
	2. The detainee must be examined by the ship doctor and be found fit for isolation.
	3. In case the detainee is a danger to himself, he must be relieved of his shoes, belt and any other object that may be used for self harm.
	4. In case the detainee is not a crew member, he should be transfered to Federal Authorities at the next station or facility the ship is going to dock at.
	5. Food and water must provided to the detainee in a timely fashion and in a respectful frequency.
	6. The detainee must be allowed access to sanitary facilities.

# Relief of a Commanding Officer by a Subordinate

It is conceivable that most unusual and extraordinary circumstances may arise in which the relief from duty of a commanding officer by a subordinate becomes necessary, either by placing the commanding officer under arrest or on the sick list. Such action shall never be taken without the approval of the Chief of Naval Personnel, as appropriate, or the senior officer present, except when reference to such higher authority is undoubtedly impracticable because of the delay involved or for other clearly obvious reasons. In any event, a complete report of the matter shall be made to the Chief of Naval Personnel, as appropriate, and the senior officer present, setting forth all facts in the case and the reasons for the action or recommendation, with particular regard to the degree of urgency involved.

In order that a subordinate officer, acting upon his or her own initiative, may be vindicated for relieving a commanding officer from duty, the situation must be obvious and clear, and must admit of the single conclusion that the retention of command by such commanding officer will seriously and irretrievably prejudice the public interests. The subordinate officer so acting

1. Must be next in succession to command.
2. Must be unable tn refer the matter to a common superior for the reasons set forth in the
preceding paragraph.
3. Must be certain that the prejudicial actions of the commanding officer are not caused by instructions unknown to him or her.
4. Must have given the matter much careful consideration, and have made such exhaustive
investigation of all the circumstances as may be practicable.
5. Must be thoroughly convinced that the conclusion to relieve the commanding officer is one which a reasonable, prudent and experienced officer would regard as a necessary consequence from the facts thus determined to exist.
​

Intelligent, fearless initiative is an important trait of military character. It is not the purpose of these regulations to discourage its employment in cases of this nature. However, because the action of relieving a senior from command involves most serious possibilities, a decision to do so, or to so recommend, must be based upon facts established by substantial evidence, and upon the official views of others in a position to form valid opinions, especially of a technical character. An officer relieving his or her commanding officer, or recommending such action, together with all others who so counsel, must bear the legitimate responsibility for, and must be prepared to justify, such action.

HVLI, considered by some as an antiquated idea, can be seen on almost all navy vessels. The HVLI are a set of lead non-combustible high velocity projectiles fields by an electromagnetic rail gun mounted on any surface. A standard HVLI volley shots 5 projectiles in a direct line.

Rail guns were first used by colonial forces during the first revolt, as they were a perfect weapon against federation stationary stations. Unlike federation ships that had both high maneuverability and formidable hull, stations, being stationary, could be hit consecutively with high levels of accuracy, thus negating the low damage potential of non-combustible projectiles.

With the introduction of the electro-gravimetric field technology and the creation of bigger and stronger shields, rail guns and non-combustible weapons became obsolete for many years.

Only during the second revolt did a need for cheap and easily manufactured projectiles arise in the federation navy. Armaments needed to be created close to the conflict areas, as those areas became further aways from sol. It was during this time that general Friedrich von Mackensen ordered asteroids to be mined and new rail guns be installed on his ships.

Mackensen understood the relative weakness of the projectiles against modern shields of the time. To combat this Mackensen ordered the the projectile to be both bigger and contains elements of both copper and iron in the ball. Giving the projectile a small magnetic field before lunch allowed them to bypass weak areas in the enemy shields and causes damage to the ship's hull itself. General Mackensen was awarded the star of the federation at the end of the war.

The impulse drive is the only long term propulsion available for ships as other methods such as warp drives are extremely inefficient in terms of power usage. Due to this, impulse is generally used in either tactical combat or movement in close proximity to other ships.

After the first revolt navy command has concluded that federation ships needed the ability to make instant maneuvering during combat. For this, the federation navy started equipping all navy vessels with maneuvering jets.

Maneuvering jets fire a high energy wide arced ion beam. These beams push the vessel with tremendous force in the opposing direction.

# Jump Drive

Invented by the Federation Technology Corp in the year 2237. The Jump drive was created in order to address the growing demand for instant travel of navy ships. Although already in development, the revolt of 2234 emphasised the importance of instant travel for navy ships.

The technology is a closely guarded secret of the Federation Navy. Personnel that require direct access to a Jump Drive must pass rigorous tests and background checks. Even technical staff on large navy vessels normally know only what they need to know in order to fill their post.

At first, the Jump Drive technology was only allowed for navy ships, this was due the strategic importance this technology held for the navy, as well as logistical and technical issues with the systems.

In the year 2250 the Sol federation allowed singular private ships access to the technology. The first civilian ship to have the Jump Drive installed was the "Cosmic Mask". Civilian ships needed to pass harsh standards in order to qualify for the usage of a Jump Drive. These qualification also require special technical support and a yearly review of the system and the ship itself.

The jump drive, due to it's high power usage a need for a full team of technicians to operate is only installed on large ships such as dreadnoughts and other capital ship classes. Despite this restriction the drive does exist in some cruiser and destroyer class ships.

Despite advances in drive technologies over the years the distance a jump drive was able to transport a vessel has never exceeded <<Redacted>>. Traveling greater distances causes the jump drive to collapse and obliterate both itself and the ship.

# Laser Beams 

The Laser Beams used in Federation ships can be categorized into three categories:
High energy beams - Laser, Electromagnetic radiation etc.
Particle beams - Photon beams, Ion cannon etc
Other - Gravitational beam
Each of the different beams is used on different navy vessels and in different circumstances. Despite the wide variety of beams the Laser beams are considered the primary attack weapon of any Federation ship.
 
Laser beams can be used for both attacking specific enemy systems and the hall of an enemy ships. Note, the laser beams do not penetrate shields. Only after a ship's shield have been dissipated by repeated laser fire can the beams attack the ship itself.
 
When analyzing ships, note the placement and amount of beam cannons available to the ship. Although standard protocols dictate that the beams be distributed in the bow of the ship, many caption have opted to diversify the placement of their beam weapons.

To counter beam weapons most ships have at least one shield generator. Firing the beam in a counter frequency to the one used by the shield will allow the beam to have maximum effect. A science officers main duty during a firefight is to note enemy shield frequency changes and report them to the weapon officer.

# Long Range Sensors

The science station of any federation vessel contains one of the most important tactical tools available to a commander - the long range tactical sensors. The long range sensors allow a ship to classify and analyze any enemy or friendly ship in a 25U radius.

On the edge of the radar are colored bands of signal interference that can vaguely suggest the presence of objects or space hazards even further from the ship, but it's up to the Science officer to interpret them.

Green - Mass spectrometer. The greater the mass of the object the greater the effect on the green line
Blue- Electromagnetic radiation. Most things emit some amount of electromagnetic radiation and the blue line indicates the amount of radiation coming from the object. The sensors are calibrated so they would also catch Hawking-Zeldovich radiation.
Red - Spectrometer. All visible and near visible wavelengths are measured by the Red line. 


## Deep Scans

The long range sensors have the ability to do a longer and more throughout scan of a vessel. This scan will return information about shield status, beam frequencies and ship systems.
A more difficult scan yields more information about the ship, including its shield and beam frequencies.
The helms and weapons screen can also see the firing arcs of deep-scanned ships, which helps them guide your ship away from being shot by their beams.


## Nebulae

Nebulae block the ship's long-range scanner. The Science officer cannot see what's inside or behind them, and while in a nebula the ship's radars cannot detect what's outside of it. These traits make nebulae ideal places to hide for repairs or stage an ambush.

##Ship Switchboards functions:

The Switchboards function as power hub to distribute power from the main reactor to different ship systems. A single switchboard can supply power to multiple ship systems.
In the event of a failure on a switchboard, it will be stopped suppling its systems and their efficiency will be affected. For example, a system that is being fed from 3 switchboard is losing one of them, will operate at maximum 77% efficiency. 
Repairing and maintaining the power relay switchboards is felling under the responsibility of the engineering department.

# LF-2 Science probe
The LF-2 Science probe was developed by the Mushai corporation and is the standard long range reconnaissance and science probe used by the Federation Navy. The probe has an active sensor depth of 4.5U and allows remote observation and analysis of objects.


All navy ships can carry the LF-2 probe. The amount of probes a ship may carry changes depending on size and classification of the vessel. In the Federation Navy the deployment of the LF-2 probe is given to the communication station which reroutes the probe’s output to the science station.


Navy protocols dictate that before launching a probe the acting officer on the bridge (if not the captain) must get a verbal confirmation from the captain. This is done in order to maximize the usefulness of a probes and surveillance in fleets.

# Shields System 
With advances in the field of beam weapons and anti gravimetric fields the need for dynamic defence systems arose. Shield systems create an electro-gravimetric field around them permeating through physical substances inside it.

Electro-gravimetric field technology is used in most spaceships today. A basic field is constantly being maintained around any space faring vehicle. This field is used to deflect asteroid and space dust that might otherwise harm both the ship and the personal inside it. The more commonly known shields are an extension of this basic fields. By exerting more power the field can be extended and expanded to surround the ship and protect it from laser fire.

Although all shield system protect against laser fire, the specific frequency of the shield determine their effectiveness. A properly calibrated laser weapon can pass through most of the shield negative field. This is done by calibrating the laser beam frequency to the reverse frequency of the shield systems.

Shields do not protect against large physical objects, such as missiles and mines. More so, a close EMP charge could destabilize the shields for a short period of time. Although the ship itself is not harmed by an EMP blast, the shield field, which is outside of the ship's hull is affected.

# Space Fatigue - Medical Condition

All modern manuals regarding the safety and regulation of long-term operations of space vessels include comprehensive treatment of the medical condition called space fatigue.
Studies have concluded that refraining from steady cycles of operation, even during emergency operations, induces the onset of Space Fatigue.
Some or all of the following symptoms result:
Tardiness, Lethargic reactions, impediments in thinking, unusual sensitivity to nutrient intake, dizziness and hallucinations.
These symptoms can be treated or at least alleviated by lying in a horizontal position, rest and person specific nutritional supplements authorized by medical authorities such as the Federated Navy Medical corp or licensed medical companies.

Remember soldier,
SPACE FATIGUE IS THE SILENT ENEMY, DO NOT LET YOUR GUARD DOWN!

# Switchboard critical failure

Critical failure can occur when the switch is suffering from a severe error that effects its core chips and caused them to fail. In this scenario, a hard reset cannot clear the error and there is a need to repair the failure within the core chips first in order.
In order to repair the chips, the engineer will need to open the designated junction box on the switchboard, connect the EMU device to the service port and to run the repair program. 

## The EMU repair program

The repair program will use different utilities in order to fix the faulty chips. It is up to the engineer to figure out which chips are requiring repair and which utility is needed.
The program will assist the engineer by providing feedback after every repair attempt, however each attempt is creating more load on the system and after 12 attempts the system will shut down in order to protect the chips from additional damage.  

## Utilities and chips

Each switchboard can have its own unique chips and required utilities. The EMU repair program will identify the chips in the system and will load the relevant utilities.

# Switchboard Electrical Fatigue

When a system is overclocked (given more than 100% power) all switchboards connected to it will begin to accumulate electrical fatigue. The more electrical fatigue a switchboard has the greater a chance it has of suffering an electrical error

A switchboard's blue indicator light signals that the switchboard is in optimal shape and has accumulated no electrical fatigue. A switch with a blue light should be able to run continuously without need for maintenance. 


## Portable Discharge Unit

The portable discharge unit is used in almost all federation navy ships and isa critical item which must be available at all times. The portable discharge unit allows a qualified engineer to discharge the electrical fatigue accumulated in a switchboard (hot reset). A hot reset will remove any excess electrical fatigue on the board but will not fix any errors if they are present.

To use the portable discharge unit simply connect it to the switch, press the red button and wait for 30 seconds until the hot reset is complete. After this time the switch will remain online and will not need to be started.

# Switchboard error handling
A switchboard's yellow indicator light will be on when an electrical fault has been caused in the switch. Despite this error, the switchboard has not suffered permanent damage and thus can be easily fixed by a restart of the board.

An electrical error can occur when the switchboard accumulated too much electrical fatigue. When a system has suffered an error all systems connected to is will begin to accumulate heat. These systems will continue to accumulate heat as long as the error is active and the switch is online.

## Restart stages - Hard reset 
 *Press red button until green indicator light begins to blink.
 *Wait 30 second until green indicator light has been switched off.
 *Press green button until green indicator light has begun blinking.
 *Wait 30 seconds for the board to be online.

## Important notes
 *When the green indicator light is off, the system if offline. 
 *During shutdown, the system is online, until the green indicator light stops blinking.
 *During startup, the system is offline until the green indicator light stops blinking. 
 *When a switchboard is offline all systems connected to it will not be supplied by the power relays on the switchboard.

# Warp Engines

First built in 2100, the warp drive allowed spaceships to create a warp field around them.
Using this warp field the ship is able to move far faster than what is possible using an impulse drive.
The first warp engine was created by the federation technology corps as an attempt at achieving faster than light speeds.

The first warp engines required a large technical staff to maintain and caused structural damage for the ship while in operation.
Some of this damage was negated when the navy developed and deployed low intensity shielding technologies to deflect minor space debris.

Warp engines today still require a large amount of power and create considerable amounts of heat.
So much so that using of warp speed 3 requires a direct command of the 1st officer or captain and warp 4 can only be issued by the captain.

Warp travel is considered safer than the jump drive, especially when covering long distances.
The is due to the fact that jump technology is not as old and reliable as warp technology and that jumps doesn't allow ships to travel to areas they have no current information about.
Because of this, all navy vessels are equipped with warp drives.

# Warp Highways - Technical Advisory

During the development of Warp Engines, A companion technology was developed. 
As limits of the warp technology were discovered, the theoretical creation of assiting technological solutions were deemed necessary.
This led to a more detailed scrutiny of how to engineer the Warping effect to create a warp highway.
Warp highways interact with warp engine technology to multiply the travel speeds possible along specific routes.

While the need for activating Warp engines in a safe distance from other objects remains in effect, activating warp engines in a warp highway has no effect unless calibrated to the highways' frequencies.
It is also possible to calibrate a warp core while already inside a warp highway, as interacting with it while uncalibrated has no effects.

A warp highway is created using specialized warp cores, activated in sync with each other. 
The larger the warp core, the longer and wider the area of effect.
Major highways have a wide area of effect with increased warp velocity the closer you fly to the center of the highway.

# Warp Jam - Scientific Phenomena

Early warp technology experiments revealed a very real danger inherent to the use of warp drives.
Even minor and remote masses caused enough spatial disturbance resulting in catastrophic engine failures.
Only deep-space, in 'clean' areas where density of residual matter was far enough from the warp engine activation point was the finalizing of the research and deploying of this technology possible.

Current standardized procedure deployed each such core with active-alert detectors that engage whenever a Warm Sequence is started.
These scanners use a derivitive technology to look for the spatial jamming caused by dangrous masses.
Only in clean space will the alert detector approve initiation of the warp speeds.
Without the detectors' approval of a safe transition, the warp core would not launch the ship into warp speed.

Standard procedure demands that 20U of clear space to be available for the safe activation of Warp engines.
failure to comply can result in catastrophic damage to the Core and Ship.

## Loss of the FNS Gogol

AT 1507 SET, on Sunday morning, December 21st, 2164 disaster struck. Several insecure harnesses in the hangar bay cause cargo to move, resulting in a severe weight shift and breaching the hangar doors as a result.
The sudden depressurization caught the crew of guard, many of whom were experiencing a vacum without any protective equipment and had died before containment was possible.

Federation Navy investigators believe that the compromise of hull integrity had caused the automated navigation systems to compensate, while the collision detection computer was not online - possibly due to damage from the hull breach - resulting in the ships course changing directly into Belt object 582c-94X in the Ceres Sector.
No survivors were found. Final casualty report stated 69 KIA and 6 MIA, presumed dead.

Comissioned on November 23rd, 2266, FNS Langley (CV-1/AV-3) was the Federation Navy's first Jump Capable Carrier, a product of a long standing dreadnaught conversion project by the federation navy. Conversion of another dreadnaught was planned but canceled when the Washington Naval Treaty required the cancellation of the partially built Lexington-class dreadnaughts Lexington and Saratoga, freeing up their hulls for conversion to the aircraft carriers Lexington and Saratoga. Langley was named after Samuel Pierpont Langley, an American aviation pioneer.


## Loss of the FNS Langley

The Langley was the first capital ship in service to be equipped with a Jump Drive. On January 7th, 2268 and despite seemingly smooth operations since the ships commission, the ship was lost to an explosion caused by an unknown complication in the jump drive systems, taking the lives of all on board as well as damaging several other navy and civilian vessels.
A nearby docking facility was also destroyed in the incident.
The incident left over 4000 dead and twice as that injured.

An investigation that followed the incident revealed that the overload of the jumpdrive could have been prevented by multiple officers on the ship, at varying stations. It appears that non of the key positions (The Drive Core, The Bridge Engineering Station, The Electronic Warfare Control Station) were manned or correctly controlled at the time of the incident, however, the reason remains unknown.
